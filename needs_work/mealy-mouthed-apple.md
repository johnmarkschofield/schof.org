I don't have an iPhone, but I noticed a red alert called "iPhone
updates" in the upper right corner of my Gmail screen. I clicked it,
which led me to an iPhone status page with an alert at the top: "<span
class="alert">Important!</span> Note to iPhone users: Apple recently
changed the way the "delete" button works for some users in the iPhone
mail app. [Learn

At the "Learn More" link, Google has a page clearly and concisely
stating the situation:

> Attention iPhone POP users  
>  If you configured Gmail access on your iPhone by tapping the large
> 'Gmail' icon in mail setup, please note that installing software
> update 1.1.3 will automatically convert Gmail on your iPhone from POP
> access to IMAP access. This means that actions you take on your iPhone
> will now sync with actions in your Gmail web interface (i.e. messages
> you read on your iPhone will show up as 'Read' in the web interface).
> This also means that messages you delete on your iPhone will be moved
> to the Trash folder in the Gmail web interface, and thus deleted after
> 30 days. Please exercise caution when deleting messages, as this
> behavior is markedly different from POP access.

It has an even, calm tone, and just states the facts and what you can do
about them. Let's compare that with Apple's page:

> iPhone and iPod touch: About Gmail and Deleted Messages
>
> Messages in a Gmail account could be permanently deleted after 30 days
> if you:
>
> -   Are upgrading from software version 1.1.2 to 1.1.3 and had created
>     the account using the Gmail preset.
> -   Create a new Gmail account after upgrading to 1.1.3 using the
>     Gmail preset.
>
> In both cases, when you delete a message, the message will be put into
> the Gmail Trash (the Trash folder that you can see when you access
> Gmail via the Google web site) and will be purged after 30 days.
>
> To avoid this and to "archive" deleted messages you can create an
> "Other \> IMAP" account and configure it for Gmail by manually
> entering your account settings. In this configuration, deleted
> messages will be moved to a different folder that isn't automatically
> purged after 30 days.

Now, I'm not implying that the Apple piece is hysterical. Quite the
contrary, it downplays the situation. They imply that Apple had nothing
to do with this situation; that it's a Google issue. And I think the
reason is quite simple: Changing people's settings without notifying
them just isn't cool.

I fully support the decision to move from POP accounts to IMAP on
newly-created accounts -- IMAP is definitely a better experience for
users. But the update should have either not changed existing accounts,
or should have OFFERED to upgrade to IMAP, while providing the option to
remain at POP. Otherwise users who don't notice they've been converted
to IMAP could delete months of messages wholesale by mistake.
