In much of the web, being called an Apple Fanboy simply means you're
debunking myths thrown about by Mac-haters. And the
[Macalope](http://news.cnet.com/8300-13509_3-20.html) is great at that.
And if that is being an Apple Fanboy, then I am guilty. There's a lot of
hate thrown around there just because Macs are "cool" and [some people
have a problem with
that.](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/may#sat-31-forbes)

However, there's some talk around Apple's projections of selling 10
million iPhones in a year that are [starting to bother
me](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13509_3-9956241-20.html).

Frankly I don't care if Apple beats their projections or not. This won't
affect the quality of the iPhone, the quality of other Apple products,
or anything else I care about. I'm not a cheerleader, I'm someone who
wants to use products that don't suck. And as long as Apple's products
suck less than anyone else's, I'll use Apple.
