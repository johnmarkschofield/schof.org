This [article on Daily
Kos](http://dailykos.com/story/2005/3/21/162132/268) (largely lifted
from another site) makes a great point -- Bush signed a Texas law that
allowed doctors to pull the plug on a brain dead patient if their family
can't foot the bill or get insurance to pay. If this fuss over pulling
feeding tubes is a moral stand, it's a recent conversion.

I see things in [Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/) I wouldn't
otherwise know about. It's worth a daily visit.
