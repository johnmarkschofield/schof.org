I went up to Ventura to visit my friends T. and J., and their daughter
R. Took a bike ride down to the beach with T. and R., and took some
pictures of them running around. It was twilight, and trying to shoot
without flash and no tripod meant blurry photos. I like this one anyway:

This one is the last photo I'll be posting for a while, as it was
approximately 3 seconds later that R. ran into me kneeling there and
shoved my lens back into my camera, breaking the mechanism.

Now it makes a series of clicking noises when you turn it on or off, and
the lens doesn't extend or retract properly. I'm hoping I can get it
fixed. If not, well, I guess that's where my money from moonlighting as
a Python programmer is going.
