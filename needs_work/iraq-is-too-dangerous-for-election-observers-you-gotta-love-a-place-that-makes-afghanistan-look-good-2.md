What pissed me off tonight? I watched television. (Besides the fact that
the NBC anchor Brian Williams seemed like a real dick. He says "A
thousand bodies were piled against that bridge by the river" the way
other people say, "A thousand bags of flour were delivered to the
families.") Then I watched the Daily Show -- and, as sometimes happens,
got a lead to a story I hadn't seen reported elsewhere. Iraq is
apparently too dangerous to enter, so the international observers who
are going to ensure that the Iraqi election is fair and proper will be
[monitoring the election from
Jordan](http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/1307651/posts). (I guess they
figure there's no point in getting killed to report "Elections were
marred by widespread violence" when it's obvious that's what's going to
happen.

And nobody's really campaigning, and one of the three major groups will
likely stay away from the polls in droves, and the other two groups will
stay away in mini droves because the terrorists have made it clear that
anything associated with the voting process including voters will be a
target. Many Iraqis have developed a "What, me worry?" attitude towards
violent death and would be willing to vote -- witness the fact that
people are still willing to enter the Iraqi police and military -- but
still, given the resources needed to protect them there won't be many
polling places, so lines are likely -- and lines of voters would be a
juicy target for a car bomb. Insurgents will almost certainly target as
many voting-related targets as they can on voting day.

We've been told a variety of reasons for invading Iraq. To free its
people. To free its oil. To fight terrorism. Whatever. So we stay, in
what looks like -- well -- you know. The Q-word. Because we're not
supposed to say "quagmire." Shit. Said it. We're stuck, 'cause if we
leave Iraq will most likely devolve into civil war and become a breeding
ground for regional instability, and if we stay, it's more of the same.

US soldiers will keep dying, the price of keeping Iraq from complete
shitholedom. (It's a partial shithole now -- but complete shitholes look
more like Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda at their worst.)

We're stuck. And, like quicksand, the harder we push -- the more
brothers, uncles, cousins and fathers we kill -- the more doors we break
down and dignity we violate -- the more suicide bombers and snipers we
generate. I really don't think there's a non-nuclear solution. We don't
seem to be capable of the kind of judo required to put down an
insurgency, and we won't have enough troops to subdue it by force unless
we institute a draft. I believe now that, no matter which President is
in office (because the Iraq occupation will probably outlast several
Presidents) he would withdraw from Iraq rather than institute a draft.
But I've been wrong before.

If someone could show me a plan with a credible chance of success, or if
events should prove my pessimism misguided, I'd be elated. I'd love for
US troops to leave Iraq because it's a flowering, functioning democracy.
But I don't think that's in the cards right now, so if the choice is US
troops leaving after a much larger number have died or leaving now, I
say leave now.
