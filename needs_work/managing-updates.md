I'm not clear at this point what the "best practice" is for handling
updates to things I've written. Not that I'm at ALL anal-retentive (oh
no!) but I've made about 20 changes to each of these posts after I first
published them. Should I be marking the updates? Using strikeout and
different colors to indicate deletion and insertion? Or just making the
edits?

For now, I'm just making the edits. I think I'll have a "cooling off
period" just after I post where I'll make any changes I feel are
needed -- and if I make changes long after a post is published, I'll
mark those changes on the post. We'll see how it works out.
