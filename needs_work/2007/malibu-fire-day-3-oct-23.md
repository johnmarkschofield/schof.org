structure count.

**Update 9:01 AM:** News from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/)

> A different mood in town today, where the staging area at the Civic
> Center has grown and become more organized. Firefighters from many
> counties tend to their rigs and their gear. Breakfast is served, even
> as helicopters fly over, low and loud, on their way to Pepperdine's
> water source.
>
> The roadblock between western Malibu and town is gone. The Shell
> station is open and selling gas. Businesses remain closed, though some
> storefronts have lights on as owners return.
>
> Here's today's sunrise, from Bluffs Park. Huge plume of smoke from
> southern fires drifts across the skyline.

> allow ANY residents into Topanga, via the valley or PCH. It is unknown
> when this order will be lifted. We will update as soon as we can gain
> clarification.

> **RESTRICTION LIFTED**  
>  Updated 10-23 8:00 am: The restriction on Residents entering Topanga
> via all access roads has been lifted. Topanga Cyn. blvd is closed to

**Update 9:32 AM**: [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/alerts/) says 15%
contained; full containment expected by Friday Oct. 26. (Info as of 8:20
AM Oct 23.)

> Latest update Oct 23 8:20 am:  
>  Fire has currently burned 4400 acres, and even with increase of area
> since last night, the containment level is now increased from 8% to
> 15%. LACFD reported the perimteter of the fire is essentially the same
> (see below). LACFD also expects full containment by Friday Oct. 26.

**Update 9:35 AM**: [LA County Fire](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/)
reports acreage at 4400+ and containment at 15%. Good news, and matches
T-CEP info from earlier. Even better news is T-CEP statement above that
"perimeter of the fire is essentially the same."

**Update 9:38 AM**: Good news from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/):

> I just drove from Trancas to Cross Creek and back and the city's
> getting back to normal. Tancas Market is open, as is the Starbucks
> there. Lots of espresso, pastries and war stories. No newspapers, but
> people are being pretty good about sharing.Trancas Chevron, the Point
> Dume gas station, the 76 station near Corral, and the Chevron next to

>
> Ralphs and CVS both open. Parking lot filling up with people shopping,
> staring, and taking pix like the one below.
>
> Lots of tents going up at the command center at the Civic Center,

>
> Some fire companies already heading south. Kern County's convoy got
> big cheers and loud honks from locals driving by.

(Thanks to M for the tip -- see his comment below.) Things do seem to be
looking up. This one is closer to under control. Still, if you're in a
Mandatory Evac zone, GO.

**Update 10:20 AM -- SUMMARY**: Things appear to be looking up for the
Malibu / Canyon fire. It hasn't moved much from where it was last night,
and containment figures are up. A change in wind direction means all
bets are off, and there could still be houses very close to the fire
that are threatened -- but for everyone else, things are looking up.
Fires elsewhere in the state aren't cooperating as much, and there's
lots of bad news from those fires. The Western side of the Malibu /
Canyon fire appears to be under control, and the Eastern side appears to
be holding. If you are in a mandatory evacuation area, you should still
GET OUT IMMEDIATELY. If you are in a voluntary evacuation area, use your
own judgement based on this and other news sources, and what you can see
and smell for yourself.

**Update 11:06 AM**: Very few updates, probably because the fire appears
to be standing still. [Good news from
Brett](http://blog.sudosu.net/2007/malibu-fire-day-2-oct-22/#23comment-3380)
in a comment on yesterday's updates:

> I just went up to the top of the hill where I live, overlooking the
> ridge by Stunt and Las Flores area, looks much better than yesterday,
> no planes, no smoke visible, winds still strong in our favor.

**Update 11:30 AM**: The most-excellent M superimposed the very vague
Malibu City Fire Map from 6 AM today on a map with roads and etc. that
we can actually read. Click the map for image size options. [Full-size
version
here.](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2179/1713443943_c7dffe4f78_o.jpg)
Thanks very much,
M![![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2179/1713443943_ee63a8a449.jpg?v=0)](http://flickr.com/photos/schof/1713443943/)  
This pretty much confirms what we already know. (And because the fire
hasn't moved much, this is probably still accurate.) News to me was the
small area of fire BETWEEN Las Flores and Topanga, by PCH. I haven't
heard any mention of that from anyone. I'll be updating the Google Map
shortly. M said in an instant message (and I agree): "Definitely heard
nothing, but it could possibly match up with the reports that lower
topanga had been under evac orders for a while."

**Update 11:37 AM**: Update from [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/alerts/)
stamped 11:09 AM:

> Residents are now able to go in and out of the Canyon with proper ID.
> Restrictions will be upheld in Zone 8. There will be no traffic into
> Zone 8, which begins at Tuna Canyon and Saddle Peak. Both roads are
> closed and Sheriffs are posted.

**Update 12:01 PM** Updated the [Google
Map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&t=h&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.04345,-118.678093&spn=0.055474,0.042143&z=14)
with the info that M provided from the Malibu City Fire Map.

**Update 12:14 PM**: Krystal pointed me to a [list of fire
maps](http://searchengineland.com/071023-111626.php) -- many have been
linked previously on this site, but others are new -- they cover all of
SoCal, focusing on the San Diego fires, as they are the largest and most
serious at the moment.

**Update 12:26 PM**: News from [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/alerts/)

> October 23 - 12:02 PMThe smoke that Topanga Residents are currently
> seeing and smelling is being blown into the Canyon from other
> out-of-the-area fires.

**Update 1:06 PM**: From [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/alerts/)

> On Tuesday, October 23, at 7:00 p.m., the Los Angeles County Fire
> Department and the City of Malibu will conduct a community meeting to
> provide information regarding the Canyon Fire incident. Officials will
> discuss the current status and projections for lifting evacuation
> orders and re-opening roads. City officials, Sheriff's Department
> representativea and Animal Control representatives will also be on
> hand to provide information and answer questions. This meeting will be
> held at Malibu High School, 30215 Morning View Drive.For those
> residents who are unable to attend the Tuesday meeting due to any
> remaining road closures, a second meeting will be held on Wednesday,
> October 24, at 7:00 p.m. at the Agoura / Calabasas Community Center
> located at 27040 Malibu Hills Road in Calabasas.

I won't be there, but I'm thinking that T-CEP and other news sources
will cover it. If you're going to be there, please send me notes from
the meeting to jschofield@gmail.com.

[LA County Fire](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/) is reporting 22
structures damaged or destroyed in the Malibu / Canyon fire.

City of Malibu has updated road closure information:

> While it is understandable that residents, business owners, and those
> who work in Malibu are anxious for roads to open, please note that
> roads must be kept clear for Fire and Sheriff's personnel and for the
> many utility employees who are working to restore telephone, electric,
> and cable service. Please comply with road closures and stay out of
> the area unless absolutely necessary.Road closures: The following are
> "hard" road closures - closed to everyone, including residents:
>
> \* Malibu Canyon from Civic Center to Piuma  
>  \* PCH between Webb Way and Las Flores  
>  \* Schueren Road from south Saddle Peak and Stunt  
>  \* Piuma at Schueren  
>  \* Saddle Peak east of Schueren  
>  \* Tuna Canyon between PCH and Saddle Peak
>
> PCH is open from the eastern city limits to Las Flores and from the
> western city limits to Webb Way. However, you will not be able to get
> past those points, even if you are a resident.
>
> This information was provided by the Fire Department as of October 23
> at 12:30 p.m.
>
> Please note that road closures are subject to change as conditions
> change. The information provided here is based on information provided
> to us by the Fire and Sheriff's Departments.

**Update 1:17 PM: EXCITING NEWS** City of Malibu has updated evacuation
information.

> Updated Evacuation Information (10/23/07 at 1:00 p.m.)The following
> evacuation orders remain in place:
>
> Mandatory evacuations: Las Flores Canyon, Sweetwater Canyon, Carbon
> Canyon, Carbon Mesa, Rambla Pacifico, Topanga Tactical Zone 8, Top of
> Piuma and Schueren Road
>
> Voluntary evacuations: None

I'll call T-CEP to see if I can confirm that the voluntary evacuation
orders have been rescinded.

**Update 1:20 PM** E-mail from SREWolf that I'm publishing verbatim:

> Hey, your blog and maps have been very useful. However, please double
> check the meaning of the pink area near big  
>  rock on the Malibu 6am map before announcing bundles of new fire

I'll look into updating the Google Map to show extinguished areas. Fire
appears to be out on Western front, but I have no idea what extent of
fire is at Eastern side. I've heard reports that it's limited to Las
Flores canyon, but I'm really not sure. If anyone has any confirmed
information, please send it to me and I'll update the map with that
info. E-mail is jschofield@gmail.com.

**Update 1:26 PM**: Good news! I called T-CEP; they confirm that
voluntary evacuation orders have been lifted. All mandatory evacuation
orders continue unchanged.

**Update 1:29 PM**: List of County Road Closures [dead link]

**Updated 1:36 PM**: [Updated Google
Map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.108393,-118.646164&spn=0.198985,0.291824&z=11&source=embed).
Fires in area along PCH between Las Flores and Topanga changed from fire
symbols to question marks; they seem like they're not likely to be a
fire. Removed voluntary evacuation symbols. Changed some fire symbols on
Eastern side of map to green. (There is no black fire symbol.) Would
love to change more red fires to green; please send info to
jschofield@gmail.com. (And if I've missed a notice in one of the items
I've posted that should have changed a red to green, please let me know.
There's a lot going on here; I may have missed some.)

**Update 1:48 PM**: M sent me an updated burn map with the questionable
area between Las Flores and Topanga removed. ([View in
highest-detail](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2418/1715324883_471ae0ec25_o.jpg).)  

[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2418/1715324883_06e390653e.jpg?v=0)](http://flickr.com/photos/schof/1715324883/)

**Update 2:15 PM** I have updated the [Google Maps
page](http://local.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.074275,-118.6726&spn=0.229209,0.253029&z=12&om=1)
to reflect the road closures on the [LA County
page](http://dpw.lacounty.gov/rmd/roadclosure/results.cfm). Things to
note: It did not mention the residents-only closure at Topanga &
Mulholland. Coupled with the lifting of the voluntary evacuation from
the Northern Topanga Canyon area, that's probably correct. I took it
out. Also, "Latigo Canyon Road @ Mile Marker 2.08" is closed; open to
residents only. I have no idea where mile marker 2.08 is; placement of
that road closure is approximate.

**Update 2:38 PM**: From [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/alerts/): "Change:
Mandatory evacuation orders have been lifted for Powderhorn and Monte
Vista roads." [Google Map
update](http://local.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&z=12&om=1)
shortly. Symbol for a lifted mandatory evacuation is a martini glass.  
**Update 5:02 PM**: [LA County Fire](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/)
says "Direction of the fire: Holding Still." Good news again! NASA has
[updated satellite
imagery](http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/socal_wildfires_oct07.html).
The [City Of Calabasas says](http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/):

> At least 4400 acres burned, 15% Contained  
>  14 structures damaged, 8 destroyed  
>  Current fire personnel on scene: 900The fire is currently limited to
> hot spots in the Piuma Road and Saddlepeak Road areas. The fire is NOT
> yet under control and high winds are expected this afternoon which
> could cause larger flare-ups to develop.

The City of Calabasas also had an update on Charter Communications
cable/phone/internet status:

> Charter Communications crews were in Malibu early on Tuesday to begin
> the restoration of fiber-optic lines destroyed on Sunday by the Malibu
> fires. Approximately 4,000 feet of fiber were burned near a critical
> crossing of Pacific Coast Highway, disrupting cable, Internet and
> telephone service for approximately 90 percent of Charter’s customers
> in the community.Charter crews are now installing wire strand to
> support the new cable. Services will return gradually; first telephone
> and Internet service followed closely by off-air broadcast signals and
> then digital cable channel. Charter expects that customers will have
> service restored between 6:30 and 8:30 pm this evening.
>
> Charter advises that there may be “pockets” of customers who remain
> out of service due to fire damage not evident until the majority of

**Update 5:17 PM**: I've changed most of the active fires to inactive
(green) on [the Google
Map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&ll=34.073848,-118.683243&spn=0.110055,0.133038&z=13&om=1&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6).
This is based on the information that the fire remains only in the Piuma
Road and Saddle Peak Road areas. Please do NOT use this map for
life-or-death decisions -- I'm doing the best I can with vague,
non-specific, and sometimes contradictory information. For instance I
suspect that the fire is concentrated around the Eastern side of Piuma,
and I could mark the ones on the West side as green -- but I'm being
conservative for now. As Brett pointed out in a comment below, it's far
better to celebrate too late than too early.

**Update 5:25 PM**: [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/alerts/) says that all
of Topanga Canyon Blvd. is open!

Zone 8 is closed, but Topanga Canyon Blvd. does not run through Zone 8.
Called [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/alerts/). They confirmed that they
were just told that all of Topanga Canyon was open from Mulholland to
PCH. They could not confirm the exact location of the currently burning
areas, but said the Eastern flank was around Las Flores and Piuma. I'm
leaving it burning on the [Google
Map](http://local.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.072853,-118.669081&spn=0.057019,0.062399&z=14&om=1)
for all of Piuma until I get more confirmation.

**Update 6:27 PM**: Holy crap! [LA County
Fire](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/) says, "Direction of the Fire: No
active fires at this time." Is that fire-speak for "not burning?" I sure
hope so!

**Update 6:33 PM**: City of Malibu says "6:15 p.m. 10/23/07 - Pacific
Coast Highway is now open in both directions." Good news! But [LA County
still lists PCH as
closed](http://dpw.lacounty.gov/rmd/roadclosure/results.cfm). Hmm.

**Update 6:39 PM**Just called [T-CEP](http://t-cep.org/); they confirm
[LA County Fire's](http://fire.lacounty.gov/) 15% containment figure but
have heard nothing about "No active fires."

**Update 7:07 PM**City of Malibu reports 75% containment. That's far
higher than I've seen anyone else report. (All other sources say 15%.)

**Update 7:18 PM**: I'm standing down. Malibu fire appears to be no
longer a threat to inhabited areas; it may be out altogether. Look here
for updates (and e-mail me) if things get more active; otherwise the
need for minute-by-minute updates appears to be past. Thanks VERY much
to everyone who helped make this site useful. My thoughts go out to
people in Malibu and Topanga who lost their homes, and people in other
areas of Southern California who are still battling wildfires.
