One of [Dakim](http://www.dakim.com "Dakim Inc.'s Web Site")'s [m]Power
devices (located at a client site) wasn't communicating with our servers
correctly, and it took five hours and a bunch of people to correctly
diagnose the problem.

On the call we had a member of the client's IT staff (at the corporate
office), a member of Dakim's support staff (on-site at the client
location, which is not the corporate office), myself, and two different
members of Secure Computing's Sidewinder support team. (The first one's
shift ended, and he transferred us to a different tech.)

Let me say first off that I was TREMENDOUSLY impressed with Sidewinder's
support. (I hadn't been familiar with their products before this.) Both
techs were ninjas, and we started speaking with them after about 30
seconds in the hold queue.

After we'd been on the call for a while, we were able to rule out
Sidewinder as a part of the problem, and the Sidewinder tech got off the
call -- and a short while later, we ruled out Dakim's [m]Power and
Dakim's servers as part of the problem -- it was a problem with the
client's network config. We stayed on the phone with them and on-site,
troubleshooting until we were able to diagnose the issue and tell the
client exactly where the problem was.

This was absolutely a money-loser for Dakim, and economically a bad
decision -- between the remote tech and myself and drive time, this cost
Dakim between 12 and 14 person-hours, for a problem that turned out not
be our responsibility at all -- but I really like working for a company
that provides that kind of customer service. There wasn't anybody
looking at us and tapping their watches -- from the CEO down we know the
costs of this kind of support, and we still want to provide it. I feel
good about that.
