Kate and I took six people up a fire road near Top Of Topanga -- hiked
along the fire road for about a mile until we reached a hill with a
great view, and then ate a picnic dinner while we watched the sun set,
the city lights, and the moon rise. All in all it was a great hike!

This is Krystal B., who knows far more pirate jokes than I expected. The
rest of the photos are in [the usual
place](http://www.flickr.com/photos/schof/sets/72157600579486715/ "Flickr set for Top of Topanga Full Moon Hike.").
(I didn't take many this time.)
