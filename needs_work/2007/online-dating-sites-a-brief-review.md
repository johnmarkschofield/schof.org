K. and I broke up a few months ago, and I've been doing the online
dating thing recently, with mixed success. Here's some brief notes on
the online dating sites I've tried, to hopefully speed other people
through this process. I'm 35, male, straight, and live in Los Angeles --
if you differ significantly from that, you may find some of these sites
more or less useful than I did. (First link in each mini-review goes to
the main site; second link goes to my profile.)

-   [Consumating.com](http://www.consumating.com "Consumating.com"):
    Free site. Lots of hipsters in their 20's. Not a lot of women in
    their 30's. Has a fun, quirky vibe that makes it a kind of fun site
    to hang out on, but not terribly useful as a dating site. Everyone
    gets a numerical rank based on their points. ([I have 29 points,
    which puts me in 4348th
    place.](http://www.consumating.com/profiles/Geeky_Hiker "John Mark Schofield's Consumating Page"))
    Relive the unpopularity of high school, electronically. (For some
    reason they didn't use that as their slogan.)
-   [OKCupid.com](http://www.okcupid.com "OKCupid.com"): Free site.
    Another fun site with lots of games, quizzes, and etc., both created
    by editors and by other users. Slightly more oriented towards dating
    than Consumating, but just as filled with 20-somethings. Less of a
    "cooler-than-thou" vibe than Consumating. The site "gets to know
    you" by asking you hundreds of multiple choice questions submitted
    by users, and attempts to match you with people who have similar
    answers. Not very successfully, [in my
    experience](http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=schofinator "John Mark Schofield's OKCupid Profile").
-   [HotOrNot.com](http://www.hotornot.com "Hot or Not "): Pay site.
    Triumph of the shallow. It's all about the pictures. You get less
    than a paragraph to describe yourself, and the user base does not
    seem terribly literate. Again, mostly people in their teens and
    early 20's. HotOrNot started as a site where you rate people's
    "hotness" on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being highest. I signed up for
    HotOrNot in order to find out [which of my
    photos](http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=RERESLE&key=UMG "John Mark Schofield's Hot Or Not Page")
    were considered "hot" (or "least ugly") so that I could use the
    higher rated pics on other dating sites. For that purpose, I highly
    recommend HotOrNot (and that part is free), but as a dating service,
    HotOrNot was an "eh" for me.
-   [Impersonals.com](http://impersonals.com "Impersonals.com"): Free
    site. Honestly, by far my favorite of all the dating sites, at least
    as far as user interface and functionality. And the questions they
    ask produced [my favorite of all the profiles I've
    created](http://impersonals.com/profiles/thedude "John Mark Schofield's Impersonals Page").
    A really cool site, without a lot of BS, and with a good feel to it.
    The downside: At least in my area and demographic, very few people.
    And very few additions -- it seems to be foundering. I'd LIKE to
    like Impersonals -- but there's just very few women (of any age) in
    my area, and most of them are in their early 20's.
-   [PlentyOfFish.com](http://www.plentyoffish.com "Plenty Of Fish"):
    Free site. The MySpace of dating. Meaning it's phenomenally popular,
    and phenomenally ugly. [Good Lord, it's
    ugly](http://www.plentyoffish.com/member5394395.htm "John Mark Schofield's Plenty Of Fish Profile").
    If you care about user interface, web page aesthetics, or design of
    any kind, this site will make your eyes bleed. (As an example, they
    don't crop pictures to squeeze them into a box, they just squeeze
    the picture into a box -- so everyone looks either anorexic or like
    a sumo wrestler, depending on the aspect ratio of the original
    picture.) Still, it has the largest user pool of any site I've tried
    yet, and the users seem to include all ages. (I'm perfectly willing
    to date a brilliant and mature 18-year-old -- but I think the odds
    of finding someone I'm compatible with are much better for women
    less than five years older or younger than I am.)
-   [Gk2Gk.com](http://www.gk2gk.com/ "Geek 2 Geek") (Geek 2 Geek): Pay
    site. Decent enough dating site -- not as gimmicky or Ajaxy as
    OKCupid or Consumating -- fairly standard, in fact, with the
    exception that the people on it are explicitly looking for geeks.
    Since I am one, this site goes high up on my list. Niche dating
    sites are apparently a big draw these days. The matching is no more
    effective than on any other site -- perhaps less so for me, because
    although [I'm a computer
    geek](http://www.gk2gk.com/profile/details.asp?USER=133478 "John Mark Schofield's Geek 2 Geek Profile"),
    I'm not most other types of geek -- and almost all of the questions
    are related to zeroing in on what geek hobbies and/or obsessions you
    have. Geek 2 Geek has one annoying quirk: If you edit your profile
    (even changing one character in the title), then people are not able
    to view your profile and you're not able to send a message to anyone
    until your profile has been approved by Geek 2 Geek staff. Geek 2
    Geek does generally approve your changes within 24 hours (even on
    weekends) but it's still an annoying bit of suckage. (Unlike every
    other pay site listed here, Geek 2 Geek will NOT automatically renew
    your subscription -- which is a nice bit of class.)
-   [Chemistry.com](http://chemistry.com "Chemistry.com"): Pay site. A
    service of Match.com, Chemistry attempts to do a "scientific"
    analysis of your personality, and match you up with compatible
    people. Their advertising targets eHarmony.com, a similar site that
    has some pretty distasteful limits. (For instance, eHarmony won't
    serve gay people.) I have my doubts as to how effective the matching
    is, but the user-contact system they put in place seems to work very
    well. You get up to 10 "matches" a day, assigned to you by the
    system. If the system doesn't assign you a match, you can't look at
    them. (This is why I haven't posted a link to my profile -- as far
    as I know, I can't.) You tell Chemistry if you're attracted to each
    of the matches. If you say you are, Chemistry lets them know and
    lets them state whether they're attracted to you. If they're not
    interested in you, their name silently falls off your list of
    potential mates. Because of this, this is the first site I've seen
    where women will initiate contact with men in significant numbers.
    (On most other sites, the guy has to send the first e-mail -- the
    sites let women initiate contact, it's just that societal norms of
    men initiating contact in meatspace exist on dating sites as well.)
    Once you both agree that you find the other interesting, you answer
    some fairly meaningless questions about the importance of various
    personality traits by moving sliders to indicate importance. The
    other person does the same. Then, if both parties decide that the
    sliders match up enough, you take it to the next level. (I say the
    sliders are meaningless because -- I mean really, if I rate "sense
    of humor" as important and she doesn't, I'm not going to reject her.
    I'm going to try and find out if she laughs at my jokes and can make
    me laugh.) At the next stage, each party chooses two questions (from
    a list of a few dozen, or write your own) for the other party to
    answer in paragraph form. Each party reviews the other's answers,
    and decides whether to take it to the next level, which is e-mail.
    After e-mailing back and forth, you can decide whether or not to
    meet in person. As I write this, it sounds HORRID -- but perhaps
    because I'm a socially awkward geek, this computer-mediated dating
    really seems to work very well. It takes some of the initial
    awkwardness out of the introduction -- and dating, online or in
    person, is awkward enough as it is.
