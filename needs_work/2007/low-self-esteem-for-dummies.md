I was in Rite Aid picking up a prescription, and noticed a bookshelf of
"Dummies" books there -- "Diabetes for Dummies," etc. Among them I saw
"Depression and Anxiety for Dummies." That one struck me. If you're
actually depressed, buying a book on it and helping yourself is about
the LAST thing you'll actually do.
