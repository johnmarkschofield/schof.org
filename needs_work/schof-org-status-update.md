It's time for some [Inside
Baseball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_baseball_(metaphor)) about
schof.org. There haven't been too many change to the site that most
people noticed, but I've made some significant changes under-the-hood,
and I thought I'd take a moment to speak about them, and also about the
tools I use to make this website.

This is a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blog, hosted on
[WPEngine.com](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=398786&U=672925&M=41388&urllink=).
I previously wrote about [my search for a home for my
blog](http://schof.org/2012/08/03/finding-a-blog-home/ "Finding a Blog Home"),
and everything I wrote there still stands. I still recommend
[WPEngine.com](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=398786&U=672925&M=41388&urllink=)[1.
I'm a WPEngine.com affiliate, so I get paid if you click that link and
subscribe.]Â I'm a big fan of WordPress as a blogging tool -- it's a
large enough ecosystem that you've got every tool you could possibly
imagine, and it's flexible enough to do just about anything. Sure, [a
lot of people complain about
WordPress](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&tbo=d&noj=1&site=webhp&source=hp&q=wordpress+sucks&oq=wordpress+sucks),
but I think it's good enough for the vast majority of uses.

I recently switched from the (free)
[Ascetica](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/ascetica) theme to the
(paid) [Standard Theme](http://standardtheme.com/). So far I'm a big fan
of the Standard Theme. I like the look, and it's been fairly simple to
customize it to suit my needs.

I use the following plugins:

-   <span
    style="line-height: 13px;">[Akismet](http://akismet.com/?return=true) --
    automatically put spam comments in a spam folder. Without this
    plugin it would not be possible for most blogs to have comments. In
    a few days I have a few hundred spam comments that Akismet has kept
    me from having to deal with. So far I've never had a false positive,
    although there have been a few false negatives (spam comments that
    found their way through the filter).</span>
-   [BWP Google XML
    Sitemaps](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps/) --
    Generates an [XML Sitemap](http://sitemaps.org) that tells Google
    and other search engines about the pages on this blog. Useful to get
    your blog pages listed in search engines.
-   [FD Footnotes](http://flagrantdisregard.com/footnotes-plugin) --
    Gives me the footnotes I use on this site.[2. I love footnotes.]
-   [Jetpack by
    WordPress.com](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/) --
    Jetpack is a multi-purpose collection of plugins published by the
    same guys who created WordPress. I use it primarily for the equation
    support (letting me put nicely-formatted equations on the site) and
    because it provides statistics about user visits.
-   [Post Revision
    Display](http://www.movingtofreedom.org/10/07/30/wordpress-plugin-post-revision-and-diff-viewer) --
    This is the most important plugin on the site. If I modify a post or
    page after it's been published, Post Revision Display puts that
    information at the bottom of the page, and lets you see whatever
    changes I've made. I consider this plugin **vital to the credibility
    of this site**. I stand by the content I publish, and if I get
    something wrong, you'll be able to see that I've fixed it, and what
    my original mistake was.
-   [WP-Syntax](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/) -- Gives
    me nicely-formatted output when I put some computer source code in a
    post. I haven't been using this much lately, but since I've been
    investigating using Python for financial analysis, it may get more
    use in the future.

I'm also using Google Analytics to give me a little more data than
Jetpack does about how people use the site, and I'm running a single
Google Ad on each page to help offset the cost of running the site.

In addition, we've got a new [Advertisement
Policy](http://schof.org/advertisement-policy/ "Advertisement Policy"),
a new [Privacy
Policy](http://schof.org/privacy-policy/ "Privacy Policy"), and a
[Pingdom Status Page for
schof.org](http://stats.pingdom.com/5ycxk2ej0gaj).
