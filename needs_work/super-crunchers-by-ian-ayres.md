[Super
Crunchers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553805401/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553805401)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0553805401),
by Ian Ayres, is subtitled "Why Thinking-by-Numbers Is the New Way to Be
Smart." It's all about the use of numerical analysis, regression
testing, and randomized assignment to learn more about a variety of
topics, from the quality of wine to the quality of medicine -- and how
to use those techniques for great benefit -- either of mankind or of a
particular commercial entity. (And like any other technology, the "super
crunching" techniques Ayres talks about can be used for good or ill --
to test the benefits of a program to empower single mothers, or to
determine the exact "pain point" of a consumer and price a good just
slightly under that pain point.)

Despite the highly-technical nature of the subject, Ayres does a
fantastic job of keeping it accessible and interesting throughout the
book. Highly recommended.
