...and really fucking stupid.

I use smart playlists quite a bit in Apple iTunes to create a mix of
songs I haven't heard in a while, new additions to my library, and songs
I like quite a bit. It's a little more complex than just random play.

If you try to create a smart playlist using the rating (1 to 5 stars)
you've given songs, it's broken, and [selects the wrong number of
stars](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303119 "iTunes is broken").
There's no way to select the exact number of stars you want.

How exactly does this get past any reasonable testing process?
