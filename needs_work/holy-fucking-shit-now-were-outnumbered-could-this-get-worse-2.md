[Iraqi insurgents outnumber U.S. forces - (United Press

First of all, yes, I know. This could get worse. In fact, it undoubtedly
will leading up to the scheduled election this month. But still.

If I saw any chance that American troops could make a long-term positive
difference in Iraq right now I'd consider keeping them there. But with
the unending stream of bad news and leaders seemingly incapable of
leading, there doesn't seem much chance of anything resembling a success
in Iraq. Just more of our boys and girls coming home in body bags for
nothing.
