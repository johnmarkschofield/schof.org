I [previously announced
this](https://twitter.com/schof/status/464903718618427393), but I
thought I'd add a little more detail here. May 19, 2014 was my first day
as a RackSpace DevOps Engineer.Â I'm tremendously excited to be a part of
RackSpace, both because of the great company and great team I'm joining,
and because of the tremendous opportunity I've been given to learn
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) from some of the best people in
the business.

(I'm actually required to note, at this point, that all my opinions are
my own, and don't necessarily represent the views of RackSpace, its
investors, its other employees, or really any other person or entity in
this or any other solar system.)
