I've never met a nicer bunch of freaks than the artists of the [Freak
Show Deluxe](http://freakshowdeluxe.com/) (FSD), a retro-futuristic
collection of acts rescued from carnival side shows and the seamy,
late-night side of state fairs.

FSD is an entertaining, funny, and often cringe-inducing show -- I saw
their act twice before I started shooting them, and enjoyed myself
immensely both times.

For a group of people who can seem somewhat intimidating on stage,
they're an amazingly gracious, kind, and funny group backstage. I was
honored to be there for the three shows I shot.

I wasn't surprised by how hard working these professionals were -- it's
common in small theater. I wasn't prepared, however, for how much these
people damage themselves in the course of their acts. Some of it is
incidental to the act -- you can't walk on broken glass without cutting
yourself occasionally -- and some of it is done deliberately in
cold-blooded preparation for a show. (Don't worry. I wasn't able to
catch most of the mayhem on camera, and I promised not to reveal some of
it.)

However, most of what happens on stage is exactly what it appears to be.

The [rest of my shots are up on
Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/schof/sets/72157626971280483/), but
I really expect that only FSD cast members and their mothers will be
looking at that -- there's a whopping 443 photos there.

I'd like to offer a sincere thanks to the FSD cast -- I'm incredibly
glad that they welcomed me into their backstage lives, and I'm very
happy to have met such a talented and friendly bunch.
