I just [posted an
article](http://www.linode.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=382&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=)
in the [Linode.com](http://www.linode.com)Â forums. It's the beginning of
a howto on installing a new linode and configuring it to host multiple
domains. Right now it's more my notes on how I installed this system,
but I hope it will grow into something else.
