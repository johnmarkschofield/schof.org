It's hard to count the number of ways this pisses me off. Speed is a bad
drug. Of the illegal drugs with large market shares, speed is probably
the worst. This isn't about that, or about this lawyer, who seems like a
real scumbag who needs to be in jail. This is about crossing a
constitutional line. For a lot of good reasons, we make the police jump
certain hurdles before they can invade an individual's privacy. The
price of that is that sometimes, the police know someone is guilty but
can't prove it. It's not a perfect world, and the founding fathers made
tradeoffs in fashioning the Bill of Rights. Personally, I approve of
those tradeoffs.

The ruling says that attaching a GPS bug to someone's bumper is no more
invasive than tailing them, which police are already allowed to do, but
I think that's bullshit. It doesn't pass the stink test. Planting a bug
to record someone's voice would be illegal without a court order. Why
should a bug that transmits location be different? I can think of at
least one situation where a GPS bug is markedly different from police
surveillance -- when the vehicle is on private property. Don't just
think Wyoming ranches -- my Dad drives the cars he restores around all
the time in his 1/4 acre backyard. Should the police be privy to that
information whenever they want, without having to ask for a judge's OK?

If this decision doesn't get reversed on appeal it'll be a black mark
against civil rights -- not like this is anything unique lately. I was
expecting another reason to hate [George
II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush), but it turns out Hurd
was appointed in [September of
1999](http://www.uscourts.gov/ttb/nov99ttb/milestone.html), which would
make him Clinton's doing. Nice job, slick.
