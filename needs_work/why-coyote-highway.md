So I'm looking for a name for my website. All variations on "John
Schofield" are taken. I like coyotes — both the sound of the word and
what it means. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, near the hills
surrounding it, and was always hearing stories of coyote sightings or
coyotes eating someone's pet — they're a breath of the wild that's
cunning enough to live near the city.

So I started playing around with names based on coyote, and came up with
[coyotehighway.com](http://coyotehighway.com) — sounds wild and cool;
has echos of road trips taken and strange things seen — so I grabbed it.

Though I speak Spanish, Coyote Highway has a connotation that hadn't
occured to me at the time. A Coyote is one who smuggles immigrants into
the USA from Mexico, usually through brutally hot and dry deserts. Many
clients of legitimate coyotes die from exposure or thirst or heat — and
there are many less-than-honest coyotes who rob, rape, and murder their
clients.

Never even occurred to me. But for the record, that's not what I was
thinking.
