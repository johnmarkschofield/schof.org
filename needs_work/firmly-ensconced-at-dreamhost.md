So we're firmly ensconced here at DreamHost, and I've got to tell you it
feels pretty good. The control panel is great, the one-click installs of
MediaWiki or WordPress are great, and most of my urgent tech support
inquiries have been answered in about 15 minutes.

The only bobble so far is that their database server has gone down a
couple of times, for anywhere from two to twenty minutes. They say
they're working on the problem. Since WordPress depends on its database,
if the database server goes down, all you see on this site is a
"database error" page.

So far they get a "B." If they can keep their servers running they'll be
assured an "A."
