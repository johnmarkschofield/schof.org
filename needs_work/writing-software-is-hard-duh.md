[Great
article](http://www.gamearchitect.net/Articles/SoftwareIsHard.html) by
Kyle Wilson on why software is hard to create:

> Talking about a software development schedule more than a year out is
> like talking about where we go after we die.Â  Everyone has some idea
> where we'll end up, but those ideas differ wildly, and there's a lack
> of solid evidence to support any of them.
