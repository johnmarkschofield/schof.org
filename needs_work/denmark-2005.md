My Mom and I flew to Denmark in 2005 to visit relatives. We flew into
Copenhagen, stayed with my aunt for a while, and then rented a car and
drove around the country visiting relatives and seeing the sights. It
was the last big trip my Mom was able to take -- her Alzheimer's makes
travel impossible now.
