My first reaction was, quite honestly, "at least they're getting
intelligence before invading this time." I wonder who came up with that?
Too bad they didn't try that before invading Iraq.

My second reaction, of course, is that this is looking more and more and
more and more like Vietnam. Cross-border incursions into Cambodia,
anyone?

Further down in the article there's even an argument that invading Iran
would cause the secular forces in Iranian society to raise up against
the religious leadership and overthrow them. Well, Lord knows our
current administration has never made a mistake estimating public
sentiment in an Islamic country -- they really did get met with roses
after invading Iraq. Oh, wait, that didn't happen. Do the hawks in this
administration really lack the ability to see the mistakes they've made
in Iraq? Apparently so, because they're hell-bent on recreating the same
mistakes elsewhere.

This isn't quite how you're supposed to build an empire. First conquer a
country, check. Next, subjugate it -- we're still working on that.
Conquor another country is step three -- but we're really good at
conquering, so perhaps we'll just keep doing that and skip the actual
controlling.

I'm trying to keep the rage going here, but it just keeps slipping into
despair. Can our leadership really be this incompetent, or is there some
Machiavellian goal here that I'm just missing?
