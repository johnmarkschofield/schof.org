[U.S. Military Envisions Reaching Its Goal in Iraq Within a Year - US

Two things. First of all, the insurgents are not trying to "provoke" US
soldiers. They are trying to kill them, not upset them. If we can't
frame the problem using language that has some relationship with
reality, how do we ever expect to solve it?

Second, he "envisions" Iraqi forces "continuing to deny terrorists safe
haven in Iraq." Perhaps he should instead envision someone <span
style="font-weight:bold;">starting</span> to deny terrorists safe haven
in Iraq. <span style="font-weight:bold;">There are thousands of times
more terrorists in Iraq now than there were before we invaded.</span>

Interestingly, another branch of the Department of State seems to take a
more realistic view. This cranky old man has used the travel advisories
put out by the State Department on many an occasion -- they're generally
pretty accurate. Here's [what they have to say about
Iraq:](http://http//www.travel.state.gov/travel/iraq_warning.html)

Didn't they get the memo? I actually wasn't aware that it was especially
dangerous to go between the only two areas in Baghdad that are
controlled by the US and remotely safe -- the airport and the Green Zone
AKA International Zone. (When did they stop calling it the "Green Zone?"
It was "Green" because it was safe -- it was the only place in Baghdad
where you could walk around like a normal person. Except, with all the
mortar and bomb attacks in the Green Zone lately, maybe not so much.)

And what exactly is "appropriate security?" It never specifies. Does
that mean "a bodyguard who doesn't wear black socks with sandals" or
does it mean "an Abrams tank with a SEAL team escort?"
