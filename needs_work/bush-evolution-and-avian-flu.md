I find it fascinating that [President Bush is trying to raise money for
Avian flu
preparedness](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/11/02/bush_plan_offered_to_fight_a_flu_epidemic/).
Because, as Bush correctly said, Avian flu can only be transmitted from
birds to humans at present. The danger is that the Avian flu might
mutate into a form that is communicable between humans -- in which case
we could be looking at an epidemic.

Bush is concerned that Avian flu might evolve. Hmm. Via an Intelligent
Designer? Perhaps the
[Pastafarians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism)
are behind this...
