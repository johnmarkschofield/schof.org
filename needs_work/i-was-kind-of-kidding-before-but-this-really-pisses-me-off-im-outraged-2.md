I don't believe we should be in Iraq right now. I don't believe any of
the administration's stated reasons hold water. But regardless of your
feelings towards the war, you should be outraged that our troops are so
poorly protected. (Many of the military vehicles in Iraq are armored.
But all of our troops should have ceramic chest plates, and all vehicles
should be armored to the best of our ability. That is simply not
happening now.) Death is a part of all wars. But we should do everything
in our power to keep that death toll low.

[According to
CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/12/08/rumsfeld.troops/):

Funny when you figure that CNN puts Rumsfeld's quote above on Wednesday,
December 8, and two days later on Friday, [the Army increased its order
with its current
vendor.](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-12-11-humvee-increase_x.htm)
Apparently they hadn't asked if the vendor was operating at capacity.
Pissed off yet? I wonder how many armored Humvees could be produced if
the administration and the military actively tried to get more? I'm
fucking furious.

**Until every soldier and every vehicle has good armor, our
administration is letting our troops down.** And since all of our
administration's actions are done in our name (even those of us who
voted against it) we also bear responsibility for letting the troops
down.

Doesn't feel nice, does it?

Soldiers are [taking hits while inadequately protected by improvised
armor:](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6700920/site/newsweek/)

Steel's not that great a choice for armor anyway (compared to Kevlar or
other high-tech materials) because when hit really hard (like by an RPG)
it turns into shrapnel. But it's a hell of a lot better than driving
around Iraq in a stock Chevy Suburban, which is approximately the same
level of protection as an un-armored Humvee.

Many of the [things soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan need to protect
themselves](http://www.techcentralstation.com/122104B.html) are
impossible to get in a military PX or through the military supply chain,
but would be readily available in the United States:

There are plenty of people who would love to do something for the
troops, but don't know what. And there are plenty of services for
sending messages to the troops. The problem is, how do you connect the
generous folks and the GIs? As individuals we could help our
servicepeople right now -- by corresponding with a random service
member, asking what they want, and sending it to them -- but I think
many more people would use a system where they could purchase something
online, have it shipped to an APO address, and know that they had helped
keep a GI alive -- something with a little less effort, wrapping paper,
and trips to the post office. That's not a dig at anyone, but the simple
truth is that if it's easier, more people will do it.

I'm thinking of a kind of "Amazon Wish List" for US servicemen and women
stationed overseas. Perhaps it could work like a message board --
service members would post requests, and people would post comments as
they responded to the requests. (That way the same person wouldn't get
1000 pairs of socks.) Fulfilled requests would drop off the board.
Service people could repost their requests if the goods never showed.

I'm very open to hearing about someone who's already doing this, someone
who wants to help doing this, or someone who has a better idea for doing
this.

lot of this came from his site.
