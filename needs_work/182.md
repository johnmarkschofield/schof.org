My essay, "[A Performance Poetry
Manifesto](http://schof.org/2002/01/17/a-performance-poetry-manifesto/ "A Performance Poetry Manifesto")"
was published in the latest issue of the [about.com poetry
newsletter](http://poetry.about.com/blpcurrLA.htm#LA12). Thanks go to
[Larry Jaffe](http://www.lgjaffe.com) for putting it in. The piece is a
starting point for a discussion on how to do good performance poetry --
I'd love to hear what you think. I'll publish interesting comments here.
