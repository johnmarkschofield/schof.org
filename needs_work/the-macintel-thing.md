I'm concerned about [Apple's move from PowerPC chips to Intel
chips](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html) for their
processors.

[Geekable](http://geekable.com/blog/2005/06/06/reassembling_the_bunny.html)
says "The Apple-Intel announcement makes me feel very uneasy. My first
problem with the whole affair is that Apple will now be considered a
generic PC vendor." As far as I can say, who cares? And if the
competitive pressure brings Apple's prices down, yeehaa.

There's even many arguments to made for the change -- among others,
Apple has the ability to switch from Intel to AMD almost at will now --
they're not really a prisoner of Intel any more than they were a
prisoner of IBM.

What worries me about this is that Apple is making a big bet, and
they're betting the farm. Handled and received poorly, this could end
Apple as a significant entity in the computer world.

I make my living managing networks of computers that include many Macs,
and personally like the quality of their hardware and software. I don't
Apple to become just a consumer electronics company.

Of course, I have a personal stake in this as well. I'm trained and
certified as a Macintosh expert; a good portion of my professional
experience is with Macs. Darn tooting I don't want them to become less
relevant and important.

This change hits me where I live. I haven't yet decided how I feel about
it, and only time will tell how wise a move it was, but make no mistake,
this is a decisive move, a big gamble with a potentially huge reward and
matching risk.
