...is that everyone has the same ones.

Reading [Defense Tech](http://www.defensetech.org) (as usual) I came
across this quote about Israel using undercover special-ops teams who
pass for Palestinian:

> Of the 2,200 arrests Israelis made in the West Bank last year, about
> 1,500 were conducted by special operation forces (SOF), including 366
> by a special Arab impersonation unit, he explained. These specially
> selected and trained personnel have demonstrated the ability to
> completely blend into the opposing population for intelligence and
> operational purposes.

It reminded me of a passage from Tony Geraghty's [Inside the
S.A.S.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898390397/officemechani-20),
about the elite British commando force:

> ...in the foetid alleyways of Aden itself the [S.A.S.] had its first
> taste of urban terrorist warfare...the launching-pad for clandestine
> plain-clothes operations...
>
> The basic concept in Palestine and Aden, quite simply, was to blend
> into the local scenery and seize on targets of opportunity. The men
> chosen for this work were those who most closely resembled Arabs...The
> next criterion of selection...was the ability to draw the heavy,
> thirteen-round Browning pistol from the folds of an Arab futah, and
> fire it with perfect accuracy... Their main quarry was the group of
> skilled, Yemeni-trained assassins...

The more things change, the more they stay the same. If US troops in
Iraq aren't doing this yet, they will be soon.
