I recently interviewed a very intelligent, capable programmer who was
near the start of his career. I decided not to make him an offer, and he
sent a very nice follow-up e-mail asking for tips on how to present
himself better. I figured my reply might be very useful to other
applicants, so I'm posting most of it here:

> First, lose the headphones. That didn't affect our decision at all,
> but I could imagine it affecting it at other companies.
>
> Second, you're obviously intelligent and capable. You messed up on the
> unit test, but I'm attributing that to interview nerves - I'm
> reasonably certain you could handle the technical demands of the job.
> But that's only the first hurdle.

> The next is personality and fit with the company -- and this is a

> you're the kind of person I want to spend the next three or more years

If it's not obvious from reading the e-mail,

management style.
