So, we had a failed piece of Apple hardware. One of my techs called the
failure into Apple, and they sent an empty box to us so we could ship
the bad hardware to Apple. There are two amazing things about this --
first, that Apple's support tech was incompetent enough to generate a
label like this, and that DHL was smart enough to actually deliver it on
time to the correct place. [![Address label entered by illiterate Apple

(I won't include his real name, but Jeff's last name is NOT "Jones" and
doesn't sound anything like that. It's pretty obvious the support rep
just made up "Jones.") The actual address:  

> 2121 Cloverfield Blvd. Suite 205 Santa Monica, CA 90404

The address printed on the label:  

> 2121, clover field , blvd sweet 205 centre monca COLORADO CA 90404
> </p>

Umm. What?
