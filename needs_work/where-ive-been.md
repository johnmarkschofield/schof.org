If you want to know why I've been MIA from this blog,
[Dakim](http://dakim.com) has something to do with it.

I've been with Dakim full-time since August 15. We're making touchscreen
devices to help mentally stimulate people with Alzheimer's Disease.
There's much about this I can't talk about on the blog, for obvious
reasons. (We're a for-profit company. We'd like to not give any
competetors who pop up a blueprint for what we're doing.) Still, there
are some things I CAN talk about.

I've been setting up the office, the technology infrastructure we'll
need to actually do most of the work we need to do. And I'm posting now
because I can see the light at the end of the tunnel -- I'm almost done
with the necessary but frustrating job of building a foundation, and I'm
actually ready to start doing original work. By the end of this week, I
should be done with all the big stuff -- there's still little stuff, but
I can do that mixed in with doing the creative stuff. It's tremendously
exciting -- I feel like a racehorse just before the starting bell.
