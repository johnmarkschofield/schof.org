> "Indeed, it's not exactly earth-shattering news at this point, but a

> confirms that Iraq has replaced Afghanistan as the world's number-one
> breeding ground for Islamic terrorists. (To what degree militants
> continue to spring up around a still-shaky Afghanistan isn't getting
> much mention in today's coverage, and presumably isn't a big part of
> the NIC report, either.)David B. Low, the national intelligence
> officer for transnational threats, said at a press briefing Thursday
> that Iraq provides terrorists with 'a training ground, a recruitment
> ground, [and] the opportunity for enhancing technical skills.' He
> added, 'There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the
> likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will,
> in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to
> various other countries.'"
