First, the epiphany -- despite all the fires, and multiple top
priorities, and projects, and all the other fireballs of stress that
scream over my desk -- there is nothing I can do for Dakim that's more
important than hiring. Over the next two years, I'm probably going to
add significant headcount to my department -- and nothing is more
important than making sure I have the right people when I need them.
(With strong emphasis on RIGHT. We're looking for rockstars.)

I need to start going to conventions, user group meetings, etc. --
immediately I'm going to start attending the Los Angeles Linux User
Group meetings and the local Python SIG. I'm not sure what else I'm
going to do, but it's becoming obvious that I don't scale -- that the
long-term solution is NOT for me to increase my skills, as I've been
doing, but to hire people who have the skills.

That said, in the short term, it's clear that there's three technical
areas where I must improve my skills:

1.  I need to be a world-class guru in apt-based package management.
2.  I need to greatly improve my skills at low-level TCP/IP issues --
    packet captures, diagnosis of networking problems, etc.
3.  I need to greatly improve my skills at dealing the Linux kernel, on
    all levels -- compiling, kernel options, loadable modules & drivers,
    etc.

I guess it's good to have a clear vision of where I need to go. Now I
need to get there.
