June 16, 2007 -- 4 to 8 p.m. Almost six miles round-trip, and more than
1200 feet elevation gain between Dead Horse Trail and Eagle Rock. We
were all hurting by the end of it. Amber S., Debbie I., Kate S., and
yours truly. It was a beautiful hike, with a constant breeze from the
ocean keeping us from baking too much. We saw a snake (not a rattler),
too many lizards to count, two separate family groups of deer (including
a baby in each group that still had the white "Bambi" spots), and a
rabbit. Grilled burgers at my place afterwards -- best damn burger I've
ever had, probably because we were so tired and hungry. (Plus, the
grilled red onions are always awesome.) [![Deer in the Trippet Ranch
