I can't access my old tweets on Twitter -- Twitter supposedly has them,
but it won't let me see them.

Facebook has privacy failed far too many times to mention here. Is there
anyone who pays attention who actually \*likes\* Facebook instead of
just using it because they feel social pressure?

And yet, I'm not ready yet to delete my accounts. Twitter and Facebook
are how I connect with a large number of my friends.

But I want to own my data. I want to have the backups myself. I want my
old posts and messages to not go away. All of this is really important
to me.

So I'm blogging on WordPress.com using my schof.org domain. I've
consolidated all my posts from other blogs and services. (I'm still
moving over photos from SmugMug, photos.schof.org.)

And now instead of posting on Twitter, I'm using WordPress' Twitter
integration to send a post to Twitter whenever I post here.

And I'm already using Twitter to Facebook integration to send my Tweets
to Facebook as wall posts.

This is a work in progress. I'll keep you posted.
