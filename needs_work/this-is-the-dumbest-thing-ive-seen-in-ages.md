I just installed Novell Suse linux on a server at work -- and had to
register with Novell in order to get updates. OK, that's fairly
reasonable.

I'm always bitchy when I see a list of countries that has the United
States listed alphabetically -- for a US company, which does most of its
business in the US, this is retarded.

Novell's registration screen was worse. They have you select the state
or region you live in -- and list almost every state and region in the
world, ALPHABETICALLY.

This is braindead. What asstard thought this one up?
