Lots of stuff pisses me off. (The link points to an article on
Salon.com. You have to watch an advertisement that makes your eyes bleed
before they let you read the whole thing. I fucking hate that.)

I also hate so many things in that article. It turns out there was no
coordination between different Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts.
None. The Kerry people were nowhere to be found in a leadership role --
due to campaign finance laws -- and no other organization stepped in to
fill the gap. Because the Republicans turned down public funding, they
were able to tightly coordinate their efforts. But you would have
canvassers from five or six different Democratic organizations visiting
the same poor people until they stayed inside with the blinds drawn and
the lights off praying for November 2nd. Other neighborhoods were not
visited by anyone. According to the article, every canvasser the
reporter spoke with confirmed the problem. If everybody at the
ground-level knew about it, why didn't it get passed up the chain to
somebody who could do something about it? George Soros pushed a lot of
money into battleground states; so did a lot of other people and
organizations. The people at the tops of those organizations certainly
could have spoken with the right people in the Kerry campaign to make
some coordination happen. Or at least, the different non-official
programs could have coordinated with each other. Many fault the current
administration for fostering a culture in which bad news is never passed
upwards. But it seems many on the Democratic side are not much better.

The writer, Farhad Marjoo, next includes a complaint that should never
even have been written down, unless the speaker was quoted out of
context. I'm only including it because it pisses me off so much!

If the guy is complaining because the copying could have been done more
cheaply, or didn't need to be done, then he may or may not have a valid
point, and Farhad should have done some minimal checking to see how
often this sort of thing happened. But if he's just complaining that he
got assigned boring work, he should shut the fuck up. Not every job that
needs to be done is glamorous or fun. The article makes the point that
local volunteers are much more effective in getting out the vote than
imports. If his work freed up a local to go door-to-door, he was making
an effective contribution to the cause he was working for. Quit whining,
bitch!
