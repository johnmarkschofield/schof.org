I own two handguns, and am planning to buy one more handgun and a
shotgun. Previously I had been using trigger locks on my handguns, but
my girlfriend and her daughter recently moved into my house, and I
decided I was no longer comfortable with trigger locks as my sole method
of securing my guns. I wanted a safe that would fit my handguns and my
shotgun. Here's the criteria I put together for choosing a safe:

-   I was not concerned with fire protection. My weapons are for self
    defense and for target shooting; I'm not a collector and don't have
    valuable or rare weapons.
-   It has to keep out curious teenagers and children, and
    non-determined burglars. (A determined, skilled burglar with enough
    time can get inside any safe.)
-   This is for home defense -- so I need to be able to get access to
    these weapons quickly. That rules out keys (fumbling for a key at 3
    AM when there's an intruder in the house doesn't seem fun) and
    biometrics (I've seen too many biometric devices fail, either by not
    letting in the approved user, or by letting in unapproved users.)
    Higher-cost biometric systems are probably more reliable, but I'm on
    a budget here. This left me with mechanical or electronic
    combination locks. I did not want a dial combination lock, as I've
    had trouble opening those under pressure in the past.

I settled on the [SentrySafe G1459E 14-Gun Electronic Lock
Safe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DELV7M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002DELV7M)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002DELV7M).
It holds far more than I need, is relatively reasonably priced, and fits
my requirements. I'm not entirely comfortable with the fact that it's
battery-powered. (If the batteries die you slide the lock pad out of the
way and remove the battery to expose a key hole.) The only low-battery
warning is that it will stop functioning when the battery is too low.
Since I open the safe several times a week, and will very rarely (or
never) open it in a crisis situation, I'm comfortable with the odds on
this, but I'd prefer something that didn't have this weakness.

I bought a couple of accessories for the safe that I can also recommend:

-   The [Cannon Safe 9000-PISTOL 2009 Door Panel
    Organizer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HH5UB0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005HH5UB0)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005HH5UB0)
    hangs on the door of the safe, providing additional storage for
    knives, flashlights, and handguns. I also keep some small loose
    objects in the mesh pouches. The pockets are velcro and can be
    attached anywhere on the organizer. The velcro appears to be strong
    enough to hold even a heavy handgun properly. I had to bend the
    mounting clips to get them to fit the SentrySafe.
-   I purchased the [Cannon Safe SSL-03-Electronic Lock Security Safe
    Light](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DWQCQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0047DWQCQ)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0047DWQCQ),
    a magnetically-attached red light that goes over the keypad. It can
    also be easily detached to allow you to view inside the safe. It's
    not particularly bright, but it does the job.
-   Moisture is the enemy of guns. I purchased a [Eva-dry E-500
    Renewable Wireless Mini
    Dehumidifer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0XFD2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000H0XFD2)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000H0XFD2)and
    am quite pleased with it. "Wireless" is a bit of a misnomer. This is
    a plastic container with desiccant inside -- moisture-absorbing
    balls that turn pink when saturated with water. This dehumidifier is
    different than others because when it's saturated, you take it out
    of the safe, plug it into a wall outlet, and a heating element
    inside heats up the desiccant, drying it out. This is the "wireless"
    part -- no extension cord, just plug it into the wall. Meaningless,
    I know -- but despite the strange name, it works great, and has kept
    the inside of my safe dry and rust-free.
