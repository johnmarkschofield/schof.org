**I:**  
Rain falls with a knifeâ€™s intensity  
and unity of purpose.  
I am wet.  
I stand in the middle of this barren world.  
This ocean of mud.  
I feel the rain on my cheeks  
and see it on my glasses  
as I look up at the sky,  
and feel it drip drip dripping  
off my hair and nose and cheeks  
as I look down  
at the mud eating my feet.

**II:**  
I spit ants from my mouth  
in the sweaty jungle night.  
As shots hit trees  
I burrow down down  
like a crab settling into sand;  
making a living grave  
just my size.

**III:**  
From the bed of this dirty pickup  
I see spread out before me  
fields so steep they look almost vertical  
overlooking the gentle, fertile valleys.  
A map of property rights  
and historical trespass  
done in green fields and brown roads  
and draped on bones  
of rock and dirt.  
The sky looks like rain.
