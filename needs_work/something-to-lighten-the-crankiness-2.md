[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) is one of the
best shows on the radio. This particular episode, [Lock
Up](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/119/lockup),
has one of the funniest bits I've heard since "[Squirrel
Cop](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/115/first-day)."

Note that the funny bit is Act 4, and there's some pretty seriously
non-funny bits before you get there. All worth listening to.
