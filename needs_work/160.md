Went to "Mia" at Tanner's in Santa Monica last night. Fairly decent
reading -- it was a mixed bag, with some earnest but really bad poetry,
and some really rockin' stuff. Standout was the feature,
[Jelena](http://www.picturetrail.com/angel-dizzign)
[Andjelkovic](http://warriorpoet.netfirms.com), who did a really solid
20 minutes. Nice hosts (Charlotte and Michelle) who did a good job,
despite calling me Jack Shofield. It's Schofield, folks -- pronounce it
like "school." And my name's not Jack. Did four pieces -- "[Tacos
México,](http://schof.org/2001/01/01/tacos-mexico/ "Tacos México")" and
three others that aren't on the web yet: "The God Man Says," "The Sky is
Clear," and "I Write." I was pretty happy with my reading -- I've been
having trouble with (in my opinion) sounding like I'm shouting when I
try to project. That's appropriate for some poems, but not for all of
them. I think I managed to get a more conversational tone in my reading,
despite projecting well. Good news. Got a pretty good response,
including a tentative offer to feature at Rapp Saloon. Will check that
out next week. All in all, had a good time. I'm looking forward to
featuring at Mia next week.
