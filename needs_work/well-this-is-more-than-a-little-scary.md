As a professional geek, I often encounter scary/frustrating/awful bugs
in software -- but this one takes the cake. I have to say, turning off
your Bradley APC with the turret extended should NOT [cause two missiles
to fire when you turn the thing
on](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/call/call_97-1_chap4.htm).
I'm just saying. The gem is this little quote: "Obviously it can be very
dangerous to have an accidental missile launch." You think?
