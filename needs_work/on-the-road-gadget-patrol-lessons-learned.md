I've done several kinds of travel -- primarily the personal type where
you travel for months out of a backpack, and traveling to a specific
place for a time period for business -- either training or to fix a
problem at a client.

This, however, is a first for me -- traveling for business to a number
of different places. I'm having to haul a fairly large amount of gear
with me, and I wanted to write down my thoughts while they're fresh.
This is not a general analysis of geeky travel stuff -- just a review of
what I brought.

-   [Swiss Gear
    Maxxum](http://www.amazon.com/MAXXUM-SwissGear-Wenger-Computer-Backpack/dp/B0007QCT0G)
    from Wenger: I really like it. I weighed it before heading for the
    airport and the pack and gear rang up at 30 pounds. It handles that
    weight with aplomb. I had to have a fairly heavy external hard drive
    shipped to me, and with that in the bag as well, it kind of crosses
    the line to "elephant on the back." Still, at smaller loads, it's
    extremely comfortable. It's really more of an urban thing than a
    hiking backpack - it's got so many pockets and dividers and other
    stuff that the damn thing weighs four pounds empty. Still, when it's
    full of laptops and hubs and electronic gear, you appreciate all
    those dividers. (It may be discontinued -- I couldn't find it on
    Wenger's site.)
-   [Speck Toughskin](http://www.speckproducts.com/vid-toughskin.html)
    for Video iPod: Love it. Has already protected my iPod from a number
    of bumps and drops. (I'm willing to forgive it not QUITE fitting
    exactly around the screen.)
-   [Kensington Pico FM
    Transmitter](http://us.kensington.com/html/10119.html): I'm not as
    crazy about the Pico. I borrowed K's for this trip because it's much
    smaller than my [Monster RadioPlay
    300](http://www.monstercable.com/productdisplay.asp?pin=3567). It's
    hard to be sure, since I don't have both with me -- but the Pico
    works MUCH more poorly in my rental car than my Monster does in my
    own car. (Too much static.) Plus, it is NOT compatible with the
    Toughskin -- doesn't fit. I ended up listening to the iPod with my
    earbuds -- only one of them at a time -- while driving.
-   Philips SHN2500: I've grown to dislike my Apple earbuds, (not
    because of sound quality, but because of comfort) and I wanted
    something noise canceling for the flight -- so I picked up these
    babies. Two thumbs DOWN. If I had four thumbs, it would get four
    thumbs down. The "noise reduction" I paid for seems to consist of
    adding white noise to the signal. No apparent reduction in outside
    noise at all -- and with them unplugged from the iPod and noise
    canceling turned on, you hear a strong hiss. With audio playing, you
    can still hear the hiss. With the noise canceling turned off,
    they're acceptable earbuds -- significantly more comfortable than
    the Apple ones.

Other travel-related lessons learned:

-   I need to learn how to pack withOUT getting my clothes all wrinkled.
    It was a lot easier when I was riding buses around and only carried
    one change of clothes with me. Since this is business, I need to
    look respectable - but as the trip progresses, I look increasingly
    homeless. If this goes another two weeks, I predict people will
    start giving me handouts.
-   Taking two laptops was stupid. No, that's not right. It was STUPID.
    (On the other hand, taking a full-size keyboard and mouse was
    brilliant. The keyboard, by the way, is the excellent [Macally
    iKey](http://www.macally.com/spec/usb/input_device/ikey.html). Say
    what you will about Microsoft's software, but their hardware is
    generally excellent. That's certainly true about the [InteliMouse
    Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=003).)
-   Don't take so many books. It turns out I have considerably less
    energy in the evenings than I thought I would -- I tend to talk to K
    for a while, and then pass out.
