It's obvious to anyone who reads a paper that Tom DeLay is a world-class
prick, but his latest act shows we've been underestimating him.

Michael Schiavo says his wife told him clearly before her illness that
she did not want to be kept alive in this way. The woman has been unable
to speak, eat, or move on her own for 15 years -- I think we have to
give her husband the benefit of the doubt here, even if you disagree
with him about keeping his wife on life support.

This passage [from an LA Times
story](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-schiavo20mar20,0,5041972.story?coll=la-home-headlines)
shows DeLay disagrees:

> DeLay, who has been personally chastising Michael Schiavo, did not
> spare him on Saturday. "I don't have a whole lot of respect for a man
> that has treated this woman in this way," he said. "What kind of man
> is he?"

What a fucktard.
