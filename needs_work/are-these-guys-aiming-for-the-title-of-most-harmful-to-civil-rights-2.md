Jeezus Fucking Christ. Won't those bastards ever quit thinking of ways
to become more evil? If they're guilty put them on trial. If they aren't
guilty let them go. If you think they're guilty but you can't prove it,
let them go with a satelite tracking device rammed up their rear ends.
But you can't imprison someone for the rest of their lives just because
you suspect they might do something you don't like in the future. That's
not the way my America does things.
