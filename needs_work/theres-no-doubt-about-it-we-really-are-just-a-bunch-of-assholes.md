There really is no limit to our chutzpah, is there? We submit this
asshole to the World Bank. (The same asshole who assured Congress that
Iraqi oil would pay for the invasion and occupation of Iraq. What a
grasp of economics.) And at the same time we are repeatedly sticking our
thumb in the eyes of the world and asking them to help us in Iraq.

Is this latest round of "fuck you's" to the world perhaps a result of
the Bush administration figuring that we're on our own anyway (except
for the Brits) so fuck everyone? I hope so -- I hope it's due to some
kind of rational thinking, rather than the pig-headed incompetence that
seems standard there.
