Frighteningly, the software (because it was new malware) was not
detected by any anti-virus software, and it was custom-written to steal
passwords to on-line poker sites. Since people gamble with real money on
these sites, this was a huge opportunity to steal usernames and
passwords and profit by withdrawing money from people's accounts.
