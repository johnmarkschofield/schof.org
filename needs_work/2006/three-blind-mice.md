Though I'm not a fan of Mensa, I found this [purported Mensa
test](http://www.mensa-test.com/) quite entertaining.

One interesting thing -- online trivia is useless as a test these days
because of Google -- this is a test that's almost impervious to
cheating. Almost.

I scored 17 on my own, and an additional five by cheating. I won't tell
you how I cheated, but I'd be interesting in hearing other people's
methods. Later I'll share my own and any that other people share.
