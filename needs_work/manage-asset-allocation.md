Asset allocation is the idea that, by combining different classes of
assets, you can greatly reduce the amount that your portfolio fluctuates
up and down. You get increased stability and safety, probably at the
expense of some gains.

For instance, if you invest only in Google stock, you'll have the chance
of doing very well if Google does well, and the chance of doing very
poorly if Google does poorly. If you invest in a more diversified
portfolio,  you'll have a much higher chance of keeping your money, with
a lower chance of making a huge killing. (Remember, the most common way
to make a small fortune in the stock market is to start with a big one.)

One of the basic tenets of investing is that you get rewarded for risk.
If a particular asset or class of assets has a high return, you can feel
assured that it has a high risk. Assets with a lower risk always have a
lower return. Anytime you see anyone claiming high return with a low
risk, you know you're seeing a fraud in action. ([Bernie Madoff claimed
this about his
investments.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal))

Asset allocation allows you to mix high return (with high risk)
investments with lower risk (and lower return) investments. This way you
still get some benefit of high-risk investments, with much less chance
of losing a major chunk of your investment.

Asset allocation (in other words, how and where to invest your money) is
a huge topic, and I'll be writing about it at great length in the future
as I get closer to [Financial
Competence](http://schof.org/2012/12/29/a-financial-roadmap/ "A Roadmap to Financial Competence").

There's two axes on which you'll be balancing your assets:

-   Among types of assets -- stocks, bonds, and subclasses of both
-   Among account types -- primarily tax-free retirement accounts and
    taxable accounts. You'll want some type of assets (which are subject
    to capital gains taxes) in a tax-free account, and others in taxable
    accounts.

Of course, since the Schofield family is still paying off debts, we're
not yet doing any kind of investment -- we've got 2 to 3 years to become
competent at investing before we actually have to do it. Which is good,
because there's a huge body of knowledge about this topic that we're
going to dive into together.

I can't end this article, however, without giving you, my Dear Reader, a
suggestion for your own asset allocation. I'm taking this from [The
Investor's Manifesto by William Bernstein](http://schof.org/?p=1966),
from the "Young Yvonne" example. It's appropriate for anyone just
starting out in investment:

-   25% [Vanguard Total Stock Market Index
    Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT)
-   25% [Vanguard Total International Index
    Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0113&FundIntExt=INT)
-   50% [Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index
    Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0132&FundIntExt=INT)

That mix of funds gives a great mix of lower volatility, lower risk, and
higher returns. We'll be doing something similar to this once we get
[our debt emergency](http://schof.org/?p=1976) handled.
