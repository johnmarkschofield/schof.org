**UPDATE: She was found. She took a walk in our neighborhood, was struck
by a bike and injured her leg, and convinced a bystander to take her to
Olive View Medical Center (20 miles away from us). There she waited in
their emergency room waiting area for 10 hours without being seen by a
doctor, until (not quite clear how) a security guard at Olive View found
one of our numbers and called us. We went to pick her up at 1:30 AM (she
still had not seen a doctor) and we'll take her to urgent care to have
her leg looked at today.**

 

Thanks very much for all of your well-wishes and prayers!

 

 

I'll be updating this post frequently.
