Wrote this down on a scrap of paper and forgot to post it until now...

This is in the tournament 4 championship, and Mekhi Phifer called down a
crazy-raising Dennis Rodman to a \$13,300 pot with ace-high and WON, the
hosts had this to say:

> **Phil Gordon**: This is just not poker than I'm used to seeing.
>
> **Dave Foley**: No, this is celebrity-style, my friend.
>
> **Phil**: (Laughing) This is celebrity-style.
>
> **Dave**: Could I say this? On that hand one of them won because they
> couldn't both lose.

probably asleep by now. Sorry about that.
