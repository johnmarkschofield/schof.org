I'm done with [Salon.com](http://www.salon.com). Done. It's an excellent
site, with a tremendous amount of good content -- I'll particularly miss
"Ask The Pilot" -- but perhaps now I'll buy his book. I certainly won't
read his column on Salon anymore.

I'm a long-time supporter of Salon -- while I've never been a
subscriber, I've always read the site and passed links and
recommendations along to friends. I was a Salon.com booster.

I didn't complain when Salon added the ads that you have to click
through before reading an entire article -- everybody's got to make a
living, and running a high-quality content website like Salon takes
money.

But the ads have been getting worse and worse, to the point now that
they're almost abusive of viewers. The spark that launched this rant was
a horrible ad for Marriott I just sat through. It runs a short
animation, then stops. There's no indication of anywhere to click to
continue into Salon, no indication as to whether you're **supposed** to
be waiting or whether something's broken. I clicked on various parts of
the thing, getting sent to the Marriott website twice -- and immediately
closing the browser window both times. I had no interest in the
Marriott, and this experience made me hostile to both Salon and
Marriott.

Finally a counter ticked over and the thing redirected me to the story I
was trying to read ... but now I'm so frustrated I don't want to read
it.

I won't make my readers put up with this shit. I won't put up with this
shit. No more links to Salon.com. No more reading Salon.com.
