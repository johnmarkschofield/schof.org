> **EPA Offers Tips to Protect Health from Wildfire Smoke**
>
> During the current wave of forest fires, EPA has the following
> recommendations on how to protect your health from the effects of
> smoke.
>
> -   Pay attention to local air quality reports and stay alert to any
>     news coverage or health warnings related to smoke. Air quality
>     reports are based on data from local air quality monitors,
>     recommending health precautions. Recent information is available
>     at
>     [<u><font color="#0000ff">http://www.epa.gov</font></u>](http://www.epa.gov/)
>     and
>     [<u><font color="#0000ff">www.airnow.gov</font></u>](http://www.airnow.gov/).
> -   Use common sense. If it looks smoky outside, avoid physical
>     outside activities and don't let your children play outdoors.
> -   If you are advised to stay indoors, keep indoor air as clean as
>     possible. Keep your windows and doors closed -- unless it's
>     extremely hot outside.
> -   Run your air conditioner, if you have one. Keep the fresh air
>     intake closed and the filter clean to prevent bringing additional
>     smoke inside.
> -   If you don't have an air conditioner, staying inside with the
>     windows closed may be dangerous in extremely hot weather. In these
>     cases, seek alternative shelter.
> -   When indoors, avoid smoking and using:
>     -   gas logs
>     -   gas stoves
>     -   candles
>     -   the vacuum
> -   If you have asthma or other lung disease, make sure you follow
>     your doctor's directions about taking your medicines and following
>     your asthma management plan. Call your doctor if your symptoms
>     worsen.
> -   If you have heart or lung disease, if you are an older adult, or
>     if you have children, talk with your doctor about whether and when
>     you should leave the area.
