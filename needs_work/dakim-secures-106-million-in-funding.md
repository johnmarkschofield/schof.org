[Dakim](http://www.dakim.com) just got a [\$10.6 million shot in the
arm](http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/02/21/idUS156951+21-Feb-2008+BW20080221).
Many of you know I've been stressed lately but didn't know why; this is
why. {grin}

We're now going to be able to focus on growth and moving forward; this
will remove a huge number of the roadblocks that have been holding us
back. It's big news.

(Unfortunately for my friends, it probably doesn't mean I'll be spending
less time at work -- we're leaping into action like a sprinter leaving
the blocks.)
