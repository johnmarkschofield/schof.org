If you're in the business of developing software, you should read the
"[Joel on
Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590593898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590593898&linkCode=as2&tag=schoforg-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1590593898)"
book. Period.

(Shortest review I've ever written.)

While I don't agree with everything Joel has written, I find most of
what he writes to be a clear exposition of common-sense approaches to
managing software development. No BS, just simple stuff that works. A
small percentage of "Joel On Software" is mind-changing, opening your
eyes to new ways of doing things or new ways of thinking about old
software.

Highly recommended.
