I just finished reading two different books on software development and
management; both are highly recommended.

First, and best is
"[Peopleware](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633439/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0932633439&linkCode=as2&tag=schoforg-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0932633439)",
by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister. This is another one of those
must-read books. I've been telling everyone that I can't believe I've
been allowed to have the job I have without reading it. If you are in
the business of software (or in the business of managing any type of
"knowledge worker,") you must read this. Really. I'm buying copies for
all the managers and execs at work.

Second is the second "[Joel on
Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590593898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590593898&linkCode=as2&tag=schoforg-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1590593898)"
book, "[More Joel on
Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KE5SLU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002KE5SLU&linkCode=as2&tag=schoforg-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002KE5SLU),"
by Joel Spolsky. I wasn't as wowed by this one as I was by the first,
but it's still very much a worthy read. Most of the articles in the
first one were new to me, while I had already read most of the 2nd one's
content on Joel's website. Still definitely worth reading.
