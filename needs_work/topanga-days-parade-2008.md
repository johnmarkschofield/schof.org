When I was living a block off of Topanga I really enjoyed heading down
to the streed for the annual Topanga Days Parade. It is a real
small-town parade, with floats made up of people's painted and tore-up
old cars. And mopeds. And horses. And skateboards. All probably
hemp-powered, since this is Topanga.
