I'm a naturally shy person, and a group of burners and goths at a
rooftop party is not exactly my natural setting. Still Charly Gienau,
one of the organizers, made me feel very welcome there, and I certainly
had a blast shooting it!

I was originally drawn to the idea of Carnival Noir by the fire
performers. (The Carnival Noir poster is in the gallery below.) I had a
great time shooting the fire art at the [Xavier Cross
Benefit](http://schof.org/2012/08/06/xavier-cross-benefit-march-2010) in
March, and I wanted an opportunity to further hone my fire photography.
I certainly got that at Carnival Noir!  There were three fire performers
outside that night, lit almost exclusively by their own fire. It made
for a challenging shooting environment. One gentlemen was blowing huge
fireballs in the air, which, although spectacular, were incredibly hard
to shoot. Still, I managed to get a few shots I was happy with, that
seemed to capture some of the energy and excitement of the moment.
 Charly's band, "[Many of Odd Nature](http://www.manyofoddnature.com/),"
was a pleasant surprise -- I really enjoyed their set! There music was
high-energy and well-done, although the crowded stage caused me some
problems as a photographer.   There were burlesque go-go dancers on
platforms in front of the stage for part of the night -- lit better than
the main stage, I'll add.  All in all the band displayed a high level of
musicianship, and I'd gladly see them again.
