After getting married, I discovered a newfound interest in financial
planning and financial matters in general. Prior to getting married, I
was content to put a little cash away each month in an automatic
transfer to an IRA. As long as my income slightly exceeded my expenses,
I was content.

Now I'm much more dedicated to the financial future of my family. I have
a 10-year-old step-daughter now, a wife who is a full-time student, and
plans for a baby in the next year or two. That's a lot of reasons to be
more financially responsible. And now that I'm getting interested in
finance and working to increase my financial competency, I find the
subject fascinating!

I've done a lot of research and put together a six-point plan to secure
the financial future of my family. I think its a plan that would be
applicable (or at least educational) to most people, so I'm writing
about it here. I'll write more in the future about each step below. You
can click each step in the list below to see all posts I've written on
the subject.

1.  [Track Income and
    Expenses](http://schof.org/category/finance/financial-competence/fc-step-1-track-income-and-expenses/)
2.  [Increase Saving
    Rate](http://schof.org/category/finance/financial-competence/fc-step-2-increase-saving-rate/)
3.  [Take Care of
    Essential Responsibilities](http://schof.org/category/finance/financial-competence/fc-step-3-essential-responsibilities/)
4.  [Pay Off All
    Debt](http://schof.org/category/finance/financial-competence/fc-step-4-pay-off-all-debt/)
5.  [Max Out Retirement
    Account](http://schof.org/category/finance/financial-competence/fc-step-5-max-out-retirement-account/)
6.  [Manage Your
    Investments](http://schof.org/category/financial-competence/fc-step-6-manage-asset-allocation/)

Of course, I don't mean to imply that I've mastered all six steps. I
certainly haven't. I'm happy with the progress I'm making on steps 1
through 4, but we're still paying off debt, and have not yet begun to
invest significantly.

I believe that mastering these steps will lead me (and you) to a high
level of financial competence. Financial competence combined with
perseverance and focus, I believe will bring my family a high level of
financial rewards. We'll be financially independent much sooner, able to
retire earlier and with a much greater sense of comfort and security
when we do.

I hope it helps you as well.
