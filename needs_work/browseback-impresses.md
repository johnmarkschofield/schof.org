So I've been playing with BrowseBack lately, and I'm pretty impressed.
It's a Macintosh product that keeps a running watch on what web pages
you visit (you can exclude pages like webmail, your online banking
sites, etc.) in a permanent archive on your computer. (You can set it to
take up as much or little space as you want.) It's searchable (easily)
and you can view pages from your archive, print them, or create a PDF
instantly.

The UI is great and very easy to navigate. It's a young program and it's
got some issues (for some reason ads on pages often show up as separate
pages and it doesn't handle PDF files or other download links well) but
it still seems like a winner. It gives the promise of never bookmarking
again -- just search your archived web history. I haven't purchased a
copy yet, but I'm evaluating it -- and will likely decide to purchase a
full version. I'll keep you posted.

About the biggest problem I have with it is that it doesn't support
getting history from
[NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/NetNewsWire.aspx) -- which is
where I spend most of my web time. Still, it's a minor peeve --
pre-BrowseBack, I had to open pages I wanted to save in Firefox to
bookmark them -- so opening them in Firefox so BrowseBack will capture
them doesn't seem a huge problem. I've e-mailed them about NetNewsWire
support, and they've added it to the list -- we'll see how long it takes
to get it in there.

Props to [Rob](http://secondsonconsulting.com/about_founder.html) for
the heads-up on BrowseBack.

**UPDATE:** (May 22, 2006) I had two full-on system freezes (no kernel
panic, no error messages, just unresponsiveness in all apps) since
installing BrowseBack. I did a 36-hour loop of Apple Hardware Test on my
system, and it found no problems. (Of course, that doesn't prove
ANYTHING -- but it tends to indicate my system hardware is OK.) Since
stopping BrowseBack from autoloading at boot, I haven't had a crash.
I'll keep testing, and perhaps re-enable BrowseBack to see if the
crashes come back, but I'm considerably less enthused about Browseback
at this point.

**UPDATE:** (May 23, 2006) BrowseBack support responded:

We'll see if it makes a difference. I have BrowseBack set to launch at
startup again.

**FINAL UPDATE:** Just too unstable. I like the IDEA of BrowseBack --
but it just crashes my system too much, which is obviously unacceptable.
I'm using Yojimbo now, which does not automatically capture pages -- I
have to click a bookmarklet to bring things into Yojimbo. That's an
extra step, but probably reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in my
archive. And it doesn't crash my system.
