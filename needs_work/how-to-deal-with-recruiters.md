I'm about to place an ad on Craigslist (Dakim is hiring; I'll post a
link to the ad here when it's up.) and every time I post an ad, I get
200 calls from obnoxious recruiters. This is an snippet of an actual
conversation that actually happened:

> **Me:** I'm sorry, Dakim has a policy of not hiring from recruiters.
> Have a nice day.
>
> **Him:** John John John JOHN! This guy was a .NET star at Disney!
> You've got to talk to him!
>
> **Me:** We don't use .NET.
>
> **Him:** We've got a GREAT Java programmer from BofA.
>
> **Me:** We don't use Java. Goodbye.

I've had recruiters try every scummy thing they can think of -- a common
tactic appears to be lying to the receptionist (telling her you're a
client) to try to get through to me.

We're rethinking the policy of not hiring from recruiters (although
we're still in the air), so I thought up a way I can deal with them
without wasting a whole lot of my time. I'll update you later as to how
well it actually works. (If this appears a little harsh, remember that
this is NOT recruiters we're hiring to help us find candidates -- this
is recruiters cold calling because they saw our ad on Craigslist. When
they call, I'll simply ask for their e-mail, and get off the phone and
send them this.)

> Dear Recruiter:

> Thank you for your interest in providing recruitment help to Dakim. We
> welcome your involvement in making Dakim a better, bigger company.

> However, to avoid wasting either of our time, we've developed a few

> 1\) All initial communication will be via e-mail. I'll call you when it's
> time to get on the phone.
>
> 2\) All e-mails providing information on a candidate MUST also provide
> the fee your company will take if we hire the individual.
>
> 3\) Dakim has no problem finding decent candidates. We have a serious
> problem finding spectacular ones. You may send us up to three
> candidates, period. (If we make one of them an offer, the count resets
> to zero.) But if you've sent us three jerks, you're obviously using the
> shotgun approach, and it's a waste of your time, our time, and the
> candidates' time.
