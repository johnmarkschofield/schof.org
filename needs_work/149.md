Installed Debian 3.0r1 (Woody) on the 2nd hard drive of my home
computer; immediately got into boot loader hell. I told Debian to
overwrite Red Hat's grub boot loader with lilo, but Debian didn't
correctly set up Lilo for booting RedHat. After two messages to the
Debian support mailing list, and considerable perusing of the Red Hat
documentation, I got it running. Now I'll be evaluating Debian as a
possible replacement for the Red Hat server I currently have running
this website.
