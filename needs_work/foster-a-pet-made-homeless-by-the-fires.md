A friend of mine is part of an effort to find temporary homes for pets
made homeless by the fires. Not all shelters will allow people with pets
in; neither will all motels/hotels. Hosting a pet for a few days can
really be a boost for someone who's looking for a place to stay. If my
place had burned, I know I'd be better able to focus on finding a new
place if I knew my pets were safe.

If you can offer up your house for a few days or a little longer, e-mail
