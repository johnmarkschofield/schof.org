Well, the "cranky old man" thing is a schtick, but the anger is
genuine -- I'm using this site to channel the disappointment and anger
that overwhelmed me November 3, when I really felt that my country had
been taken away from me.

It seemed like the end of the America I love -- the America of the
Enlightenment, of our founding fathers, of separation of church and
state, of rational thought.

Then I started to feel that anger dissipating. Because, quite frankly,
you can get used to anything. And I was starting to get used to this,
though reading the newspaper still made me sputter.

Then it occurred to me -- will I rant and rave at the next extravagant
incompetence of this administration, get used to it again, and continue
about my day? Will this anger fade simply away to despair?

No! I'm pissed off, and I'm gonna stay pissed off. This election may not
have been stolen, but this country has. Our leadership seems to think
that pretending everything's OK will make everyone ignore what may be
the worst Presidency we've had. What's even more frustrating, it seems
to be working! Is it any wonder that I'm pissed off?
