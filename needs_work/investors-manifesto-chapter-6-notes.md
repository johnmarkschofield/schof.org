Continuing our detailed review of "The Investor's Manifesto" by William
J. Bernstein, we're going to look at Chapter 6, "Building Your
Portfolio."

This chapter boils down to one sentence of advice from Mr. Bernstein:
"Save as much as you can, start as early as you can, and do not ever
stop."

<!--more-->How Much Do You Need to Retire?
------------------------------------------

Mr. Bernstein advises looking at fixed annuities if you face the
possibility of running out of money before you die. How to judge if
you're going to run out of money?

> My rule of thumb is that if you spend 2 percent of your nest egg per
> year, adjusted upward for the cost of living, you are as secure as
> possible; at 3 percent, you are probably safe; at 4 percent, you are

> that means you will need \$2.5 million to be perfectly safe, and

> a good chance you will eventually run out of money.

That's grim news for anyone with less than 1 million in savings. And
frankly, that's almost everyone. Luckily, annuities provide some help.
When you pay into an annuity, you get some percentage (6 to 8% per
Bernstein) annually, and you're guaranteed[1. Assuming, of course, that
the insurance company doesn't go broke.] that you'll receive that money
each year until you die. Once you die, the money stops, and you never
get your principal back, so it's a poor choice for those who want to
leave a legacy for their children

Investing and Dollar Cost vs Value Averaging
--------------------------------------------

On to investing. Bernstein suggests avoiding ETFs in favor of
traditional open-ended mutual funds. He includes a table of suggested
index funds (and a few ETFs) at Kindle location 2261.

Next he discusses how to save -- Dollar Cost Averaging vs. Value
Averaging.

Dollar Cost Averaging is when you put the same amount each month into
your investments. (Which is, of course, what you should do when you're
young and saving.)

Value Averaging is more appropriate to when someone has a large sum of
money that they want to deploy into their investments. Instead of buying
in one lump purchase, they buy roughly the same amount each month -- but
adjusted so that you're buying more of falling funds and buying less of
rising ones.

Frankly, Bernstein gives very little detail about DCA, I think because
he's gun-shy about putting math in his books, and so we'll have to look
to Edleson's Value Averaging book for more details. It's on our short
list of future reading.

Sample Allocations
------------------

Now to a very fun part of the chapter. Bernstein gives sample
allocations for four prototypical investors.

### Young Yvonne (No assets, just starting to save)

-   <span style="line-height: 13px;">25% Vanguard Total Stock Market
    Index</span>
-   25% Vanguard Total International Index
-   50% Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index

This gives a 50% allocation to bonds, which is high for someone of
Yvonne's age, at least according to the "keep your bond percentage equal
to your age" school of thought. This is because Yvonne is a "market
virgin," and has never experienced a down market.

Bernstein emphasizes that the bond portion of a portfolio is for safety
and security, not really for asset growth, and advises short-term,
high-quality bonds.

### Sheltered Sam (All assets in retirement accounts)

Sam has little savings outside his retirement accounts, where he as
\$500,000. Since his assets are in tax-advantaged savings, he can
rebalance without worrying about tax implications, and he can own any
asset class without worrying about its tax efficiency.

Sam holds the following funds, all of which (except for the final one,
his money market account) are in his IRA:

-   <span style="line-height: 13px;">10% Vanguard Large-Cap Index</span>
-   12% Vanguard Value Index
-   3% Vanguard Small-Cap Index
-   8% Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index
-   4% Vanguard REIT Index
-   2% Vanguard European Stock Index
-   2% Vanguard Pacific Stock Index
-   3% Vanguard Emerging Markets Index
-   3% iShares MCSI Value Index
-   25% Vanguard Short-Term Investment Grade Bond
-   20% Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities
-   5% Money Market (taxable)

Sam follows the "bond percentage equal to age" rule, having 45% of his
portfolio in bonds.

### Taxable Ted (All assets in a taxable account)

Ted had no savings, then came into a seven-figure windfall. Because of
tax considerations (which Bernstein sadly does not go into), Sam is
limited to three stock asset classes -- large-cap US markets, large-cap
foreign markets, and US small-cap stocks. Because Ted already has enough
to retire on, he doesn't need to take many risks -- he's going with a
40/60 stock/bond split.

Because he's a California resident, he's using a tax-exempt California
bond fund, but because he's concerned about California's financial
future, he's diversifying his bond holdings.

-   <span style="line-height: 13px;">16% Vanguard Total Stock Market
    Index</span>
-   10% Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap
-   8% Vanguard Tax-Managed International
-   2% Vanguard Emerging Markets
-   4% Vanguard REIT (Variable Annuity)
-   15% Prime Money Market
-   15% California Intermediate-Term Tax Exempt
-   15% Limited-Term Tax Exempt
-   15% Short-Term Investment Grade

### In-Between Ida (Assets Divided Between Retirement and Taxable Accounts)

Ida is in theory a good candidate for an inflation-adjusted annuity, but
Bernstein discounts this -- he's not confident enough in the financial
health of insurance companies to advise someone to put their next egg in
an annuity right now.

Ida is highly risk-tolerant, and will go for an aggressive (for a
70-year-old) 50/50 stock/bond split.

-   <span style="line-height: 13px;">10% Vanguard Total Stock Market
    (Taxable)</span>
-   8% Vanguard Value Index (IRA)
-   3% Vanguard Tax-Managed Small Cap (Taxable)
-   6% Vanguard Small-Cap Value (IRA)
-   5% Vanguard REIT (IRA)
-   5% Vanguard Tax-Managed International (Taxable)
-   6% iShares MCSI Value Index (IRA)
-   3% Vanguard Emerging Markets (Taxable)
-   4% Vanguard International Small-Cap Index (IRA)
-   20% Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade Bond (IRA)
-   15% Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt Bond (Taxable)
-   10% Vanguard Ohio Tax-Exempt Bond (Taxable)
-   5% Money Market (4% in taxable, 1% in IRA)

Rebalancing
-----------

Bernstein talks more about the tax implications of rebalancing:

> Investors rebalance portfolios for two reasons: to enhance return and
> to reduce risk. The excess returns generated by rebalancing are not
> large, usually no greater than 1 percent per year, which is much
> smaller than the capital gains taxes you will realize on most sales.
> So purely from a returns point of view, you should never sell stocks
> to rebalance inside a taxable portfolio. Buying is fine, of course,
> and you can also use fund distributions—the capital gains, dividends,
> and interest the funds throw off—to rebalance as well.

Bernstein advises rebalancing tax-sheltered accounts every 1 or 2 years,
and taxable accounts every 2 or 3 years.

I've been reading about [Opportunistic
Rebalancing](http://www.tdainstitutional.com/pdf/Opportunistic_Rebalancing_JFP2007_Daryanani.pdf)[2.
See also this [Bogleheads
Discussion](http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10670&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0).]
and I found it fascinating. I had forgotten that Bernstein talked about
it here, and was fascinated to see his take on it:

> Some asset classes are more volatile than others; set a 20 percent
> threshold for U.S. large cap stocks, and you will hit it every year or
> two. With emerging markets, you will be trading much more frequently.
> Finally, the thresholds will have to be portfolio-specific; using a
> fixed threshold in an all-stock portfolio will result in far fewer
> rebalances because all stock asset classes move together than in a
> nearly all-bond portfolio, where the stock moves relative to the bonds
> will be much larger.
>
> Which is better, calendar or threshold rebalancing? It is impossible
> to determine, since the benefits of rebalancing are not much greater
> than 1 percent per year; proving that one method was better than
> another would mean statistically powering the test to detect
> differences in return of perhaps one or two dozen basis points, which
> would probably take hundreds or even thousands of years of data.
>
> Because of these complexities, I recommend that beginners stick to
> rebalancing by the calendar once every few years or so. If at some
> point you do decide to switch to the threshold technique, you will
> need to develop individual rebalancing parameters that are not only
> asset-class specific, but also portfolio-specific as well. Threshold
> rebalancing for most practitioners tends to be a work in progress.
> Rebalancing a given asset class too often or too infrequently is
> usually a signal to adjust the threshold up or down, respectively.
