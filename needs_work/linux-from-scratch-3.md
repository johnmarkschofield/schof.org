Fixed the problem with static compilation -- I had, in fact, compiled a
bunch of scripts wrong. It shows the dangers of knowing a bit -- I
thought the changes I made would not have an effect, and in fact they
negated part of what the book was trying to do. Fixed it now, and well
into Chapter 6. Got through that problem, by the way, via a very quick
answer (about 10 hours) on the LFS mailing list from a gent in Holland.
On a weekend, too. Pretty cool. Still going with LFS -- waiting for
something to compile as I write this.
