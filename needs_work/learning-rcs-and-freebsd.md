This has been a heavy tech day for me. Worked again on researching
Revision Control System (RCS) on my OS X laptop and my FreeBSD server.
It finally clicked -- and RCS is much easier to use than I thought it
was. I've been working on a preliminary cheat sheet for RCS. I'll be
putting it up on the web eventually, but if you'd like an interim copy
to look at, just let me know.

Also installed eLinks on my FreeBSD system, giving me a text-based web
browser I can play around with. (Since I only have a text SSH connection
to the server, I can't do anything graphical -- at least not yet.)

Next job is to find a web-based calendar for my consulting company...
