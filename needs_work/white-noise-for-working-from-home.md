If you work from home (as I do on Mondays) and you have small children
around (as I do) then a closed door to your home office isn't enough --
even when the kids are well behaved and don't knock on your door asking
to play, there's still noise from around the house.

I'm using [White Noise from
TMSoft](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/white-noise/id289894882)Â on my
iPhone, and it's a lifesaver. They offer a couple of dozen of kinds of
"noise" -- from waterfalls to waves crashing -- but the simple "white
noise" setting is what I'm using to drown out my playing kids. Works for
me.

And, since it's playing from my iPhone, it's not loud enough to drown
out doorbells, phones, or screams of agony that I should pay attention
to.
