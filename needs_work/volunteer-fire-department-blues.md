As a big city boy I was surprised at how few resources there are to
fight fires out in the country, and pleased at how people work together
when necessary to put a fire out. I was driving through a small Arizona
town on my [LA to Colorado road
trip](http://schof.org/2012/08/03/1755/ "Road Trip From Los Angeles to Colorado, 2000"),
and saw a plume of smoke off in the distance. When I got closer I saw
there was nothing I could do to help, and pulled over to take pictures.

At first there was nobody doing anything to put the fire out, but then a
water truck (probably from a local farm) came over and started pouring
water on the fire. They pretty much knocked it down, and by the time the
Volunteer Fire Department got there (some in uniform, some not) there
wasn't much left to do but put out the embers.
