I must say, [this article by Steve
Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html)
has done quite a bit to refine my thoughts about hiring geeks. (The
beginning is a little long-winded. Push through. It's worth it.)

On the other hand, I've met exactly ONE of the type he's talking about
in my career. Not sure where that leaves me as a managing geek who needs
to hire brilliant geeks.
