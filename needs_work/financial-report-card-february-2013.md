I created an Excel spreadsheet for my [last financial report
card](http://schof.org/2013/02/07/financial-report-card-january-2013/ "Financial Report Card – January 2013").
We're still making good progress. As you can see, we're still on a good
path. Our total savings went down, because we paid off a little more
debt than, strictly speaking, we should have. The metric here I'm really
looking at is our savings rate, and how we've reduced spending over the
previous month. We were down a whole 20% over what we spent in January,
even though our goal was only a 10% reduction. I'm fantastically pleased
about that! Our emergency fund isn't as robust as I'd like, and our
percent on that actually moved in the wrong direction because we paid
off a little more debt than we should have.

Getting the 10% reduction in spending that we're aiming for in March
will be difficult. We paid a six-month auto insurance premium in March,
and had a significant car repair. We're going to have to really tighten
things up to make that 10% goal, but I'm hopeful that we'll be able to
do that!
