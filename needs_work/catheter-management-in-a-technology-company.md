This is from a "[Fresh Air from
WHYY](http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13)" Terry
Gross [interview with Dr. Richard
Shannon](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17957719),
Chairman of the Dept. of Medicine of the University of PA Health System.

It's not that Shannon tells us anything really new here. It's that he
talks about one aspect of what I'm trying to do at Dakim, and comes up
with something better than a trunk of
[Strunks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style):

"A highly-reliable, unambiguous process in which everyone's
responsibility is made clear." Damn right.
