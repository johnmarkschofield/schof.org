[The Daily Star - Politics - European press reduce Iraqi
coverage](http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=%2011781):

> "Threatened with kidnap or death, European journalists are reducing

> French and the Italian governments have formally advised journalists
> not to travel to the violence-wracked country because of the serious
> risks and critical security situation. The warnings followed the
