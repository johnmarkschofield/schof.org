Reading the [Slate.com story](http://slate.msn.com/id/2114576/) about
the Supreme Court hearing on whether government bodies can display the
10 commandments really made me wish I had been there.

> unlike a crucifix, a "historically recognized symbol of law," Scalia
> protested, "It's not a secular message. I mean, if you're watering it

> think it conveys that message, I just think you're kidding yourself."
