It's time for my end-of-month financial report card, this time for
January, 2013.

<!--more-->I've created an Excel spreadsheet that you're welcome to
[download and use
yourself](http://schof.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Financial_Report_Card_Template.xlsx)[1.
It's filled with dummy data. Replace the items in bold on the first page
with your own numbers.]. Below is a screen-grab from the report showing
exactly how we did. I think this kind of report is **essential** to
anyone trying to achieve financial competence. You need to have a clear
understanding of your finances to understand your current situation,
where you need to go, and what steps you need to take to get there.

So how did we do? As you can see, I'm doing well with tracking income
and expenses, and trying to reduce bills. The whole family did
spectacularly in reducing our spending -- our January 2013 spending is
down 31% from our[December 2012
spending](http://schof.org/2013/01/02/start-of-month-financial-competence-checklist-for-january-2-2013/ "Start of Month Financial Competence Checklist for January 2, 2013"),
and down 23% from our November spending. (Our December spending was
higher because of[our gift-giving
idiocy](http://schof.org/2012/12/30/a-no-gift-christmas/ "A No-Gift Christmas").)

And even with a 30% drop in spending, we're still (barely) spending more
than we receive. This is a sign of [how deeply broken our finances
were](http://schof.org/2013/02/06/where-i-went-wrong/ "Where I Went Wrong"),
and how far we have to go to reach our 30% savings goal.

Still, we're definitely on the right track, and I'm encouraged that we
were so far above our 10% month-to-month savings reduction goal. We're
going to have to try even harder to knock off 10% for February, but I'm
certain we can do it.
