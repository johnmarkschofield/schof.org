You should take a look at Thomas L. Friedman's [It's a Flat World, After
All](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/magazine/03DOMINANCE.html?pagewanted=1&oref=login).

In a flat, connected world, the barriers to entry for almost anything
are reduced globally. Everyone is competing. Friedman argues that the
United States is not properly prepared to compete in this new world. He
makes compelling arguments, both that we really have entered a new age
of globalism, and that the US is ill-prepared for it.
