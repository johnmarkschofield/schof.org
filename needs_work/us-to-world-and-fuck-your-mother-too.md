Two paragraphs? I guess there's none of that "Dear Kofi" or "How's the
wife?" in this.

So we're withdrawing from part of [a
treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_the_Law_of_Treaties)
signed by that notorious leftist, Richard Nixon. Why are we withdrawing
from our own treaty? Because it's getting in the way of Texas executing
death-row inmates from other countries.

Are you fucking kidding me? We are asking countries that largely do not
have the death penalty to help us in Iraq while are withdrawing from
part of a treaty we proposed years ago in order to make it easier to
kill their citizens today? Who comes up with this shit?

And in that case, what's more important? Fixing Iraq so our troops can
get the fuck out or gassing a few dozen foreigners in Texas? I guess now
we know.

Don't mess with Texas.
