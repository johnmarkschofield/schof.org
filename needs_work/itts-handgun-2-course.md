I feel like someone's been standing behind me and punching my back and
shoulders for a few hours. This is, I think, a pretty common outcome
after taking [International Tactical Training
Seminar's](http://www.internationaltactical.com/ "International Tactical")
two-day "[Handgun
2](http://www.internationaltactical.com/handgun_2.html "Handgun 2 Course Outline")"
course. Day 1, Saturday, is 9 AM to 5 PM. The 2nd day is 2 PM to 10 PM,
to incorporate night shooting techniques with flashlights and weapon
lights. Over the two days I shot off 345 rounds of [45 ACP FMJ
ammo](http://www.luckygunner.com/45-acp-230-gr-tmj-cleanfire-cci-1000-rounds#rid=schoforg "The ammunition I used during my Handgun 2 course.").
I am thoroughly impressed with International Tactical's curriculum and
instructors. (I've previously taken their [Handgun

and [Shotgun
1](http://www.internationaltactical.com/shotgun_1.html "International Tactical Training Seminar's Shotgun 1 Course Description")
courses.)

[Scotty
Reitz](http://www.internationaltactical.com/scott.html "Scott Reitz Bio"),
the owner and lead instructor of ITTS, is a former [LAPD
SWAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPD_Metropolitan_Division#History_of_LAPD_SWAT "History of LAPD SWAT")
officer and LAPD firearms trainer. The three instructors who taught my
class, [Troy Thomas, Howard Ng, and and Dane
Hurst](http://www.internationaltactical.com/staff.html "Instructor Bios"),
are all active duty LAPD SWAT team members. All three were patient,
knowledgable, and effective instructors.

The biggest problem I had as a student was understanding the difference
between [controlled
pairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_tap), accelerated pairs, and
just shooting twice. (I was also told that the instructors no longer use
the term "double tap," although I'm not sure why.) I'm still not sure I
entirely understand the distinctions. I was trying for, as instructed,
"one sight picture and two shots" and was unable to place the 2nd shot
accurately at 20 yards. I then realized that we were supposed to be
getting a sight picture for each shot, and I was able to align the
sights, take a shot, align the sights again and take another shot in
quick succession. (We were shooting "poppers," metal targets which fall
down when struck with the first bullet. You need to be fast to get the
2nd bullet to your target before it falls down and is inaccessible. )

We later did [Failure
Drills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique_Drill) (two shots to the
torso, one to the head) and I finally felt like I was able to press the
trigger twice with one sight picture and hit the target reliably. I
think I was trying to do accelerated pairs (two shots with one sight
picture) at too long a range for my current skill level. We did the
Failure Drills at 7 yards, which is a much better match for my current
skills.

By the end of the 2nd day I was so fatigued that I was having trouble
with complex actions. I was still able to shoot, but when I had a
malfunction I just stared at it dumbly until an instructor walked me
through the clearing procedure. This is partly because of the physical
and mental demands of two days of high-intensity instruction, and partly
because the course was in Los Angeles in July, and it was over 100
degrees on our outdoor range. (The instructors had us take frequent
breaks to keep hydrated, but it was still grueling.)

Right now it's Monday, the day after my class, and I'm definitely still
recovering. I'm sure I'll have more to say about it later, but right now
I'm going to close by repeating how highly I recommend ITTS and their
training courses.
