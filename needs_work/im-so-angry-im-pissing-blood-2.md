When does anger become weeping? While there's no scenario for invading
Iraq that could ever be considered rosy, the incompetence of the present
administration at pursuing its goals boggles the mind. It could never be
good, but it sure could be better than it is -- and the signs indicate
it's only getting worse.

Thousands of US and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths may lay at the
feet of this administration before all this plays out.

Here's my cold and unemotional calculus of occupation: (1) Iraq is in
danger of degenerating into out-of-control civil war. (2) The presence
of US troops is keeping Iraq from falling into complete chaos. (3) At
some point, we may discover that no matter whether or not we stay in
Iraq, it will face widespread civil war. (4) If our presence does not
keep Iraq stable then there is no point in us being there; we should
bring the troops home and let the Iraqis fight it out.

At our present rate of progress, there is little doubt that Iraq will
degenerate to that point; the only question is when. Let there be no
doubt that I hope our rate of progress does not continue downward -- I
strongly hope that it trends upward. But since the Bush Administration
seems unable to affect much change in Iraq, the question must be asked:
How many people must die before we admit we're wasting our time?
