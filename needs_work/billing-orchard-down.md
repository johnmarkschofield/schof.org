I use a site called [Billing Orchard](http://www.billingorchard.com) for
my invoicing and accounts receivable functions. I enter the time that
I've worked into their web form, and Billing Orchard takes care of
keeping track of it, sending out invoices, and tracking accounts
receivable. I've been very, very happy with them. Their charges are
reasonable, and their service excellent.

I went to their website today to enter some charges and found all pages
but this one had disappeared:

> BillingOrchard.com is currently undergoing a major site repair.

This sucks. This appears to be a case of a small company growing too
fast. It's hard to take a small system that runs on a single computer
and scale it up to a more powerful redundant solution. Blogger has had
numerous problems of this type, and eBay in its early days had similar
problems. Fixing these problems is made harder because the skill set
that allows you to build a successful web application does not always
overlap with the skill set needed to make that application work under
high loads.

I don't know that Billing Orchard is having that particular problem. I
have had no information from the company other than the message on their
website. It could be that they're incompetent, or that the one smart
person at the company just quit, or something like that. Based on my
good experiences with them so far, I'm going to give them a bit longer
before I start looking for a competitor.
