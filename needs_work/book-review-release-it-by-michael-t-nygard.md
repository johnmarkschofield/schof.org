I just finished "[Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready
Software (Pragmatic
Programmers)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0978739213/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0978739213)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0978739213)"
by Michael T. Nygard, from The Pragmatic Programmers. This isn't the
book I thought it was when I bought it, but it's still a really valuable
read. "Release It!" focuses on (and most of the author's experience
seems to be) massive, web-scale e-commerce sites, generally running on
Java. While on the surface it has little to offer to other worlds of
software development, digging a little deeper shows ideas that are
applicable across all software development.

If you're doing massive web stores in Java -- well, you've probably
already read this. If you haven't I'd say this book is a must-read. Of
course, my projects aren't web-scale, aren't e-commerce, and don't use
Java, and to this point, haven't -- so do take my comments with whatever
amount of salt you feel is appropriate.

Even if you're doing shrink-wrap software, I'd say "Release It!" has
something of value for you -- it appears to be a collection of hard-won,
common-sense techniques for creating what Nygard calls "cynical
software" -- software that assumes that itself, and the other software
it links to will all fail at one time or another, and is prepared for
that failure. A number of failure modes spring to mind, but Nygard
enumerates them, the anti-patterns that create them, and the patterns
you can use to respond to them with exceptional clarity and obvious
expertise.

In addition to being chock-full of good ideas and interesting concepts,
it's also filled with entertaining war stories about various failures
and how Nygard and his team responded to them. And for a systems geek,
there's few more satisfying ways to spend an hour than reading about the
nightmare series of cascading failures that ruined someone else's
weekend.

Highly-recommended.
