Here's the checklist I'm using each month to make sure I'm following the
[six steps to Financial
Competence](http://schof.org/2012/12/29/a-financial-roadmap/ "A Roadmap to Financial Competence").
I'll show you how I reached my calculations, but I'm going to keep the
actual numbers to myself. I will let you know each month how the
percentages work out.

I strongly suggest you use a similar checklist for your own finances.
The first step in fixing a problem is getting clarity about it. I can
tell you that I'm not happy about the checklist I'm putting below, and
that's going to be serious motivation for us to do better in the next 30
days.

 

### Step 1: Track Income and Expenses

-   <span style="color: #008000;">All income and expenses for previous
    month recorded. **YES**</span>
-   <span style="color: #008000;">Each bill paid on time. (Examine each
    bill for places you can reduce it in the future.) **YES**</span>

### Step 2: Increase Saving Rate

-   <span style="color: #008000;">Examine each expense -- can you reduce
    or avoid it in the future? **DONE**</span>
-   Goal is to reduce spending by 10% over previous month, with final
    goal of 30% of gross income going to savings
-   Spending last month: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   Spending previous month: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   [Formula for calculating
    percent](http://www.onemathematicalcat.org/algebra_book/online_problems/calc_percent_inc_dec.htm)
    -   If spending increased: (new amount - original amount) / original
        amount
    -   If spending decreased: (original amount - new amount) / original
        amount
-   <span style="color: #ff0000;">Percent increase or decrease: 10.3
    INCREASE</span>

### Step 3: Take Care of Essential Responsibilities

-   Keep 6 months of cash reserves on hand.
-   Goal: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   <span style="color: #ff0000;">Currently:
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  (10.86% of goal)</span>
-   <span style="color: #ff0000;">Should be in highest interest savings.
    Currently in Wells fargo at 0.01%. Currently waiting for response
    from Ally with 0.95%</span>.

 

Green means we met our goal. Red means we didn't. As you can see from
the amount of red, we didn't do so well in December. Part of that is
that [we went crazy with Christmas Gifts for the whole
family](http://schof.org/2012/12/30/a-no-gift-christmas/ "A No-Gift Christmas").
But very clearly we've got to get better at reducing our spending if
we're going to make this work.
