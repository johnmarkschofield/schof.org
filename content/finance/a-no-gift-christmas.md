Title: A No-Gift Christmas

My wife and I missed our savings goals this December, primarily because
of Christmas Gifts. We're not proud of that -- and from now on, only
people in the family who are under 18 get presents. Grown-ups can buy
their own toys.

My wife came up with the idea of limiting presents on her own (I'm a
lucky man!) but I also wanted to link to this [email sent by Grandpa

That's definitely the way we're going next year. It's better for our
wallets, it's better for the wallets of our relatives, and it's better
for the planet. (Why buy a bunch of crap that will eventually end up in
a landfill?)
