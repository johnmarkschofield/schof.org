Here I continue my review of ["The Investor's Manifesto" by
Bernstein](/2012/12/30/the-investors-manifesto-by-william-j-bernstein/ "“The Investor’s Manifesto” by William J. Bernstein")
with my notes from Chapter 2, which could be subtitled "Here comes the
math!"

I'm not naturally math-minded (I count on my fingers) but I've worked
through each mathematical example in this chapter using either pencil
and paper or a calculator. I **strongly** suggest you do the same. I
know in my case, I'll just skim the math parts if I don't make myself
actually do the math.

Historical returns are valuable to prepare you for the scope of boom and
bust that you may experience in your own life, but they are dangerous
when used to estimate future returns.

Bernstein talks about two relatively recent examples where depending on
past returns to estimate future ones went very badly. In the years
following World War II, inflation gradually accelerated, zooming to the
hyperinflation of the 1970s and 1980s.

> During the 30 years between 1952 and 1981, long-term Treasury bonds

Since companies can raise their prices when faced with inflation, stocks
did much better than bonds during the same period, with the S&P 500
returning 9.89% per year.

Bernstein points to a remarkable opportunity. In 1982, the interest rate
was 3.42%, and bonds were offering returns significantly higher than
that. Yet few people wanted to invest in bonds because bond investors
had lost money for the last 30 years. Investors with the insight to see
the opportunity and the fortitude to take advantage of it made a
killing.

### A Bond Yield Digression

I'm going to take a moment here to expand on some math that was not
intuitively obvious to me: "If an investor buys a 30-year bond yielding
an initial 5 percent coupon, and long-term interest rates subsequently
increase to 10 percent, the value of that bond temporarily falls by
nearly half."

Let's say I invested one year ago in a 10-year bond giving me a 5%
return on my $1,000 investment. I get $50 interest every year (5% *
$1,000). Since then, interest rates have increased to 10%. Other
investors can buy a $1,000 bond today yielding 10%. If I try to sell my
$1,000, 5% bond today, nobody will buy it -- I'll have to reduce the
price to get another investor to purchase.

If I sell my $1,000 bond yielding 5% for only $500, then another
investor would make the deal. The bond still yields 5% on $1000 ($50)
but since the new investor bought in for $500, effectively he's getting
10% return on his investment. (10% of $500 is $50).

This is why raising interest rates decimates bond value.

### My Explanation of Expected Return

Since we can not predict future returns, the best we can do is produce
an "expected return." Rather than an exuberant or morose guess, it's an
analysis based on hard financial figures -- but it's still a guess, just
a more informed one.

Expected return is a familiar concept to anyone who has studied gambling
odds. (I used to play poker.) Bernstein uses a roulette wheel as an
example. But I'm a simple sort of guy, and I've never played roulette. I
have flipped coins, though.

Imagine that you're gambling with someone by flipping coins for money.
For every time you win, you get $1. For every time you lose, you give
up $1.

The formula is (amount you get if you win * odds of winning) - (amount
you risk * odds of losing)

For the coin-flipping game as I described it, you get $1 if you win,
and your odds of winning are 1/2, so your expected return is 0:

(1 * 1/2) - (1 * 1/2)

However, if you have a foolish opponent who is willing to bet $2 for
every $1 you bet, your expected return is $0.50 per coin toss:

(2 * 1/2) - (1 * 1/2)

In that case, you can expect to make $0.50 cents for every toss.
However, you'll never actually earn $0.50 on a single toss -- you'll
get $2 sometimes, and lose $1 sometimes, and you'll average out to
$0.50 per toss if you play long enough.

I just played this game against my five-year-old nephew. (When the odds
are this much out of balance, it's good to have an opponent who doesn't
know math.) And yet he took me for a ride! The tosses were
H-H-T-T-T-H-T-T-T-T, meaning he owed me $6 for the three heads, and I
owed him $7 for the 7 tails, with a net win of $1 for my nephew.  This
gives a key insight into expected return -- it is **not** guaranteed!

If we had played the game for longer, say 100 tosses, my actual return
would have been much closer to the expected return. And thus one of the
key rules of this chapter -- you need to keep your money in for the
long-term and ignore short-term results.

One more note about coin tosses and then we'll move on -- in a coin
toss, you know the odds -- you know how many sides the coin has. With
stocks, you're guessing what you'll earn if you win **and** the odds of
winning. This makes calculating the expected return more difficult, but
still possible, and it's still a very valuable exercise to perform.**

Oddly enough, after working through it I think there's an error in
Bernstein's Roulette odds. He gives the formula as 35/37 - 1, which
comes out to -$0.54, but it's actually 35*(1/38) -  1* (37/38), which
gives the [correct expected return
of -$0.53](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette#Bet_odds_table).

I'm going to stop here, and continue tomorrow with how to estimate
expected return for bonds and stocks (and you can follow along as I
actually do it, with tomorrow's numbers.)
