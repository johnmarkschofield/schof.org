When I first heard about Healthcare Savings Accounts, I was intrigued,
then disappointed, and then forgot about them.

The idea behind an HSA is that you put money in an IRA-like account
(tax-free) that can only be used for healthcare expenses. My medical
expenses aren't that high -- why do this?

Well, it turns out I was wrong to dismiss the idea. [The Mad Fientist
has written a truly excellent piece on the advantages of
HSAs](http://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/), and I
now think they deserve a position in most people's tax-advantaged
accounts, especially if they've maxed out their other tax-advantaged
vehicles like IRAs and 401ks.
