I saw [a
recommendation](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/02/17/book-review-the-intelligent-asset-allocator/)
for "[The Intelligent Asset
Allocator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071362363/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071362363)"
by William Bernstein and checked it out of the library. It's supposed to
be (with "[A Random Walk Down Wall
Street](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393081435/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393081435)"
by Burton Malkiel) one of the essential books on investing.

Bernstein wrote two later books on asset allocation. In the preface to
"[The Four Pillars of
Investing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071747052/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071747052),"
Bernstein says he considers "[The Intelligent Asset
Allocator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071362363/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071362363)" in
part a failure because he intended it for the general public, and, "What
I instead produced was a work comprehensible only to those with a
considerable level of mathematical training and skill." Bernstein
means "[The Four Pillars of
Investing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071747052/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071747052),"
to be accessible and enjoyable to the general public.

In "[The Investor's
Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118073762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118073762)"
Bernstein laments that neither of his previous books were actually
accessible to the general public, and swears this time will be
different. I think he's right.

I'm going to read all three of Bernstein's asset allocation books, in
reverse order, starting with "[The Investor's
Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118073762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118073762),"
which I've just completed.

"[The Investor's
Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118073762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118073762)"
is a strong introductory book, but I think that in his zeal to produce
an accessible book, Bernstein has left out some vital bits of math,
particularly in regard to [dollar cost
averaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) and
[value averaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_averaging). There's
a little bit of hand-waving instead of details about how to do it. I'm
certain his earlier books provide more detail on this.

I'll be going through the book chapter-by-chapter and publishing my
notes here -- both to help you, dear reader, and to solidify the
concepts in my own head. I'll update this post with links to each
chapter's notes as I write them. Please note that reading my notes,
detailed as they are, is no substitute for reading the book. This is not
Cliff's Notes; this is a book club. You'll need to do your own reading
of the book to get the full benefit.
