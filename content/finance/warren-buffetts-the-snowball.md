I was captivated by [The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of
Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OD41DY) by Alice Schroeder. It's amazing that Schroeder was given the access
that she was, and the result is a truly fascinating book about a great
investor and businessman.

It's not a snow job by any means -- Buffett is a man with warts, and
Schroeder does her best to show the real man -- sometimes cheap,
selfish, and self-centered. Far from the legend of Warren Buffett,
Schroeder, shows us an investor who worked very hard, was brilliant, and
was lucky enough to get away with making a few major mistakes.

I found the book inspiring, both personally and professionally. The book
made me want to save more, and want to invest my savings.

Highly recommended.
