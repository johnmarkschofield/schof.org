You are Superman, and debt is your Kryptonite. If you're already
[Financially Competent](http://schof.org/2012/12/29/a-financial-roadmap/ "A Roadmap to Financial Competence")(or
think you are) you can probably come up with a dozen situations where
debt is actually a good idea. In some of them, you'd actually be right.
But if you're Financially Competent enough to use debt correctly, you're
not in the target audience for [these Financial Competence
articles](/2012/12/29/a-financial-roadmap/). If
you're still striving for Financial Competence, as I am, your primary
goal should be to eliminate all debt. Your recipe is simple:

1.  [Save as much
    as possible](http://schof.org/2012/12/30/increasing-your-saving-rate/ "Increasing Your Saving Rate")
2.  Pay the minimum on each debt, except the one with the highest
    interest rate
3.  Pay off the debt with the highest interest rate with every cent you
    can squeeze out of your budget. [Debt is an
    emergency](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/18/news-flash-your-debt-is-an-emergency/).
4.  Once you have that debt paid off, move on to the one with the next
    highest interest rate and repeat until you are debt free.

Paying off debt takes precedence over investment. It takes precedence
over everything except the [Emergency Fund and other Essential
Responsibilities](http://schof.org/2012/12/30/taking-care-of-essential-responsibilities/ "Taking Care of Essential Responsibilities").

What's our situation? Through the tiny amount of Financial Competence my
wife and I had before we got married, neither of us has any credit-card
debt. My wife has a student loan currently charging 5.12%, and I owe
back taxes to the IRS that are currently accumulating interest and
penalties at 3.25%. We're paying the minimum on my IRS debt, and putting
every penny we can save into paying off my wife's student loan. If
we're reasonably diligent, we can pay off the student loan in two
years. If we can manage to save more than 30% of our gross income, we
can do it in one year. And it may be another year after that before
my IRS debt is paid off. That's three years to be debt free, and
three years before we can start accumulating assets and investing
them. But every dollar we put towards the student debt earns us a
5.12% return. While we might be able to get higher returns by
investing, we also might get lower returns. The return on paying off the
debt is guaranteed. Every $1,000 we put towards the student loan
earns us $51.20.
