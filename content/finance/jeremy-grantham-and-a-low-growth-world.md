In my [piece on the Four Percent
Rule](/2013/01/17/investment-returns-the-four-percent-rule-and-your-personal-pucker-factor "The Four Percent Rule and Your Personal Pucker Factor"),
I talked about Jeremy Grantham's November 2012 essay, "On the Road to
Zero Growth[1. Available from the "Jeremy Grantham's Letters and
Articles" section of the [GMO website](https://www.gmo.com/America/MyHome/), but only after

marvelous recommendations Grantham has received from the likes of Bogle
and Bernstein.

> Mr. Grantham forecasted that GDP growth for the US is going to be
> about 1.4% a year, or 0.9% adjusted for inflation. (Specifically, he
> forecasts 0.9% a year through 2030, decreasing to 0.4% from 2030 to
> 2050.) This is in contrast with the greater than 3% growth rate we've
> had for more than 100 years.

I lamented that Grantham did not discuss the investment implications of
this low-growth forecast, instead promising it for a future newsletter.
Well, Grantham has delivered in his latest, titled, "Investing in a
Low-Growth World."

I was concerned that a lower-growth forecast for GDP would result (if it
was accurate) in lower investment returns. But I pointed out that
Bernstein, in [Chapter 4 of Investor's
Manifesto](/2013/01/15/the-investors-manifesto-chapter-4 "“The Investor’s Manifesto:” Chapter 4"),
said investment returns are often the opposite of those for a country as
a whole -- "high grade" countries often have mediocre results, and
mediocre[2. Sorry, Great Britain.] often have spectacular results.

Grantham backs up this view, showing that there is a mild negative
correlation between GDP growth and stock market returns. Grantham and
his company, GMO, have gone back 100 years for developed and emerging
markets and have confirmed the same negative correlation.

All this means is that we don't really have to worry about Grantham's
prediction, at least through the narrow lens of picking investment
vehicles and portfolio allocation.
