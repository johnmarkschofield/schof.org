I recently finished "[Think, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett: The
Winning Strategy to Help You Achieve Your Financial and Life
Goals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071809953),"
by Larry Swedroe. The Warren Buffett stuff is just a facade -- a shtick
to get investors who are frightened by scholarly works to read the book.
Nevertheless, the book is worth reading, and is generally well-written
and accessible. As far as I can tell, it's correct in all of its
prescriptions. None of it really breaks new ground, but it's a book
worth reading.

One particularly new bit of information I got from it was the
"[Opportunistic
Rebalancing](http://www.tdainstitutional.com/pdf/Opportunistic_Rebalancing_JFP2007_Daryanani.pdf)"
approach to rebalancing a portfolio. The idea is that you check your
portfolio often for opportunities to rebalance it (weekly or even more
often) but, because you're only rebalancing when your portfolio gets
outside a tolerance zone, you're not actually rebalancing (and incurring
trading costs) that often. As I wrote about in my [Chapter 6 notes from
Investor's
Manifesto](/2013/02/05/investors-manifesto-chapter-6-notes "“Investor’s Manifesto:” Chapter 6 Notes"),
William J. Bernstein doesn't recommend it, but it's certainly not a
dangerous idea -- per Bernstein it's simply a lot of work for probably
not much gain.

So what the bottom line on this book? It's worth reading, but it doesn't
replace "[Investor's
Manifesto](/2012/12/30/the-investors-manifesto-by-william-j-bernstein "“The Investor’s Manifesto” by William J. Bernstein")"
as my pick for the first book you should pick up in your quest for
financial competence. It's hard to match Bernstein's incredibly clear
and well-written prose. Swedroe is good, but Bernstein is better. I've
added this book to the [Reading
List](/2013/01/17/financial-competence-reading-list "Financial Competence Reading List")
in the "Optional Reading" section.
