Here I continue my review of ["The Investor's Manifesto" by
Bernstein](/2012/12/30/the-investors-manifesto-by-william-j-bernstein/ "“The Investor’s Manifesto” by William J. Bernstein") with
my notes from Chapter 2. In Part 3 of my notes, we cover estimating
returns on stocks, and a good deal more about choosing stocks and
other investments. There's some math here, but also a good deal of good
non-math information. Stick it out, please, Dear Reader.

### Estimating a Value for Stocks

You should value stocks based on the payments you get from them each
year. These payments are called dividends. The stock price goes up or
down each day based on how investors feel about the company, how they
feel about the economy in general, and whether or not the investor is in
a good mood. The dividends go up or down based on how well the company
is performing, so they're much more stable than the price.

If this seems strange, think about how we value other assets. An asset
is valuable based on the money you get from it on an ongoing basis. A
house you buy to rent out is valued based on the rent you get paid. A
bond you purchase is valued based on the interest payments you receive.
It should be the same for stocks.

We start with the
annual [dividend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend) the stock pays,
and add the historical growth rate of the dividend. The current annual
dividend is a fact. The historical growth rate is also a fact, but we're
guessing that it will apply in the future. If we take the average of a
great many years of dividend data, we're likely to get a result that
will also apply over a long period.

This formula -- adding the dividend yield and dividend growth rate -- is
called the Gordon Equation. And here, thankfully, mercifully,
wonderfully, we have some actual data -- an Excel spreadsheet Bernstein
links to provided by Yale professor [Robert J.
Shiller](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/). [You can find the
spreadsheet
here.](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls) It covers The
S&P 500 from 1871 to the present day (including 2013, which we're only a
bit into) with inflation-adjusted numbers.

Bernstein states that the S&P 500 yielded a 3% dividend in 2009. (2.67%
by my calculation.) From 1871 to 2009, inflation-adjusted dividends
increased at 1.32% each year. This gives you an inflation-adjusted
return of 3.99%.

The current expected return is similar. The 2012 dividend was 2.08%, so
adding 1.32% dividend increase we get an expected real money return of
3.4% on the S&P 500.

Here's the actual formula: \$latex r=\\frac{D}{P}+g &s=2\$ where:

-   r is the expected return
-   D is last-year's dividend
-   P is the price of the stock
-   g is the historical dividend growth rate

We can also work that equation backward if we want to specify our own
rate of return (in the case of a riskier asset) and derive the
appropriate price of the equity. (If the derived price is higher than
the actual price, we'd buy the equity.) Here's the formula: \$latex P =
\\frac{D}{r-g}&s=2\$

Next Bernstein touches on a vital point -- a growing economy does not
necessarily equal a good investment environment.  China's economy grew
at 9% annually for more than 20 years. (A spectacular result!) But
Bernstein says between 1992 and 2008, investors lost 3.3% annually in
Chinese stocks. Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and
Thailand were equally underwhelming. Often the best countries to invest
in are the staid, stolid ones people are least excited about.

Now we're done with the math for this chapter. Relieved? Actually, that
wasn't too bad.

### Different Buckets for Stocks

All stocks can be divided along two axes: size and quality. Companies
can be small or large, depending on whether the total value of their
outstanding shares is above or below that of the average US
publicly-traded company (about \$1 billion). Along the quality axis,
companies can be divided into growth, mid, or value. Growth stocks are
"glamorous, rapidly growing, 'good' companies—think Wal-Mart, Amgen,
Cisco, or, until recently at least, Starbucks—while the latter group
tends to consist of doggy, poorly growing, 'bad' companies—think Ford,
Sears, or Caterpillar. The 'mid' category contains those companies that
fall in between growth and value." Small stocks give higher returns than
large stocks, and value stocks give higher returns than growth stocks.
Small value stocks give the highest returns of all. Why? It's simply our
old friend "risk premium."

### Diversification

Bernstein advises against having all your money in stocks because of the
risk; what if your entire portfolio declines by more than half, as
occurred in 1929-1932. While in theory going all-in on stocks would
yield the highest long-term return, the risk is too great for most
people to bear. Bernstein advises having a large chunk of your funds in
bonds. [Per my earlier
post](/2013/01/05/more-on-the-estimated-return-of-bonds/ "More on the Estimated Return of Bonds"),
I think I would advise having a large chunk of your funds in something
safe, but not necessarily bonds.

### Don't Buy Individual Stocks

Bernstein reinforces [what I said about not purchasing individual
stocks](/2013/01/07/should-you-buy-individual-stocks-and-bonds/ "Should You Buy Individual Stocks and Bonds?"):

> I know what you are thinking: 'Humbug on those low returns you’ve
> calculated! I can do better by carefully selecting the best-performing
> stocks myself, and if I cannot do that, I can find a mutual fund
> manager who can. Failing that, there are plenty of folks on TV, radio,
> and the Internet who seem to know where the market is headed. Surely I
> will be able to sell before the market crashes again.' Well, none of
> these strategies work. The reason why 90 percent of investors and fund
> managers cannot pick stocks is simple: Whenever you buy or sell a
> stock or bond, there is someone on the other side of that trade, and
> that someone most likely has a name like [Goldman
> Sachs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs),
> [PIMCO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimco), or [Warren
> Buffett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_buffet). There is even
> something worse than trading with Buffett, and that is trading with a
> top executive of the company whose stock you are buying or selling,
> and who likely knows more about its condition and prospects than even
> the smartest and best- informed security analyst. Trading individual
> stocks is like playing tennis against an invisible opponent; what you
> don’t realize is that you are volleying with the Williams sisters.

Bernstein also talks about [Technical
Analysis](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:overview:technical_analysis).
This is the idea that you can judge future stock patterns by looking at
past stock patterns. Since we've already seen that you can't use
historical prices to predict future prices, it's clear that Technical
Analysis is a crock. The only people consistently making money through
technical analysis are people selling technical analysis newsletters and
tools.

> not try to time the market, and do not try to pick stocks or fund
> managers.

### The Efficient Market Hypothesis

Now we need to talk about an important concept in finance called the
Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH. This states that, "all known
information about a security has already been factored into its price."

> This has two implications for investors: First, stock picking is
> futile, to say nothing of expensive, and second, stock prices move
> only in response to new information—that is, surprises. Since
> surprises are by definition unexpected, stocks, and the stock market
> overall, move in a purely random pattern...
>
> There are actually three forms of the EMH: the strong form, which
> posits that all information, public and private, has already been
> impounded into the price; the semi-strong form, which posits that only
> public, but not private, information has been impounded into price;
> and the weak form, which posits only that past price action does not
> predict future price moves.

### Jack Bogle and the Birth of the Index Fund

Next Bernstein treats us to the story of John C. "Jack" Bogle, the
founder of [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home/). Bogle
created Vanguard so that the Vanguard mutual funds would own all of
Vanguard -- in essence, Vanguard's customers owned Vanguard. "Bogle had
essentially turned the company into a nonprofit organization, run
exclusively for the benefit of its customers."

Bogle then created the world's first index fund.

> Bogle, noted that the largest mutual funds charged about 1.5 percent
> in management fees. The efficient market hypothesis predicted that
> none of these funds could beat the market for very long individually
> and further, in the aggregate, active managers must of necessity lag
> the market by their expenses and fees, since they were the market. He
> then calculated by hand their average return and found that it was ...
> 1.5 percent less than the market: 'Voilà! Practice confirmed by
> theory,' he noted. Vanguard would start the world’s first index mutual
> fund. Initially derided by the investment industry as 'Bogle’s Folly,'
> the Vanguard 500 Index Fund eventually became the world’s largest
> mutual fund.

There are two types of this new type of fund -- index funds and
passively-managed funds. The Index Fund buys every stock in an index,
such as the S&P 500. Once a year, a Standard & Poor's committee replaces
some of the companies in the S&P 500. Any fund indexed to the S&P 500
must do so as well. Since all funds following the S&P 500 must do this
at the same time, it's a messy and expensive rush that drives up the
cost to purchase these stocks.

A passively-managed fund creates its own private index, specifically
designed to keep turnover to a bare minimum.

In either case, the costs of a passively-managed fund or an index fund
are so much lower than an actively-managed funds that actively-managed
funds simply can't compete.

There is one legitimate criticism of index and passive funds -- you
won't hit a home run. This is absolutely true. Index funds will get you
good results over time, especially compared with actively managed funds.
But putting your entire net worth in Google stock in 2004 would get you
amazingly spectacular results. The important thing to note is that
investing in Google is only a sure thing in retrospect -- it would have
been an incredibly risky move, and there's plenty of stocks that were
around at the same time and looked about as good at the time that are
doing nothing now.

The advantage of index funds becomes even more clear when you're looking
at bonds. "One portfolio of Treasury, municipal, and high-grade
corporate bonds performs pretty much the same as the next; here the
advantage of low fees rapidly becomes insurmountable. Over the 10-year
period ending December 2008, the Vanguard Short-, Intermediate-, and
Long-Term Bond Index Funds beat 99, 96, and 92 percent, respectively, of
their actively managed peers."

### A Home is Not an Investment, it's a Place to Live

Bernstein emphasizes that a home is not an investment, it's a place to
live. Historical data shows that real (inflation-adjusted) home prices
in the United States did not rise at all between 1890 and 1990. In
Norway after 1819, prices rose by 1.3% a year.

> Amazingly, economists have even assembled a series of house prices
> along Amsterdam’s tony Herengracht Canal going all the way back to the
> early seventeenth century. These show absolutely no increase in their
> after-inflation (real) prices for over almost four centuries—and in
> one of the world’s best neighborhoods to boot.

Bernstein talks about the mathematics of renting vs owning a home. If
you own, you're tying up capital that you could invest anywhere, but
you're saving the rent you'd have to pay otherwise. If you rent, you've
got the capital, and you're out the monthly rent expenditure. A rule of
thumb Bernstein advocates is to never pay more than 15 years of fair
market rent for any home.

Here Bernstein has a wonderful footnote I'll reproduce in its entirety:

> The figure I keep in mind when house shopping is 150: the number of
> months in 12.5 years. After hearing a realtor’s spiel, I will ask,
> “So, what would this house reasonably rent for?” If the number seems
> right, multiply it by 150; this will give you an excellent idea of the
> home’s fair market value, above which you are better off renting. I
> have found that this is one of the fastest ways known to man of
> darkening a realtor’s face.
