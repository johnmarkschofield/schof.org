I'm writing out the choices I'm making in the November 2020 election, and why, in the hopes that this might be helpful to other people voting this year.

In the past I've paid attention to Federal and State elections, but largely went the party line or made a guess for local contests.

Voting is too important for that now. I'm putting effort into every vote.

If you're trying to decide on a candidate that's not listed here (because they're not in my local district) feel free to ask at jms@schof.org and I'll be happy to research your candidate too. 

#### Los Angeles Community College District Member of the Board of Trustees, Seat 1
Andra Hoffman

#### Los Angeles Community College District Member of the Board of Trustees, Seat 3
Gerald Anderson

#### Los Angeles Community College District Member of the Board of Trustees, Seat 5
Nichelle Henderson

#### Los Angeles Community College District Member of the Board of Trustees, Seat 7
Chris Han

#### State Senator, 27th District
Henry Stern (D). He's on the correct side of several police use-of-force issues.

#### Member of the State Assembly 45th District
Jesse Gabriel (D). His opponent seems singularly unqualified and is a NIMBY.

#### United States Representative 30th District
Brad Sherman (D)

#### Los Angeles Unified School District - Measure RR
This is a measure to borrow $7 billion towards improving schools, and pay that money back by increasing property tax. I'm voting Yes.

#### Los Angeles County District Attorney
George Gascón. He talks the right talk about BLM and police impunity, but we'll have to hold his feet to the fire once he's elected. His opponent, the current incumbent Jackie Lacie, is funded and supported largely by police unions and has prosecuted ONE of the roughly 600 police murders done on her watch. Lacie is unacceptable; Gascón gets my vote.

#### Judge of the Superior Court Office No. 72
Steve Morgan

#### Judge of the Superior Court Office No. 80
David Berger

#### Judge of the Superior Court Office No. 162
David D. Diamond

#### County Measure J
Yes. We need to give the county the ability to move funds into social programs.

#### State Measure 14
No. Not California taxpayer's job to fund stem cell research.

#### State Measure 15
Yes. Starts charging appropriate property tax to commercial property. Does not change residential property tax. 

#### State Measure 16
Yes. Allows affirmative action again.

#### State Measure 17
Yes. Allow felons who have been released from prison but have not served out their parole to vote.

#### State Measure 18
Yes. Allow 17-year-olds to vote in some primaries.

#### State Measure 19
No. Proposition 13 crippled California by starving it of property tax. Measure 19 would make it worse by letting people MOVE a tax break from a property they owned a long time to a new property. What? We're just rewarding people for being old homeowners.

#### State Measure 20
No. This measure moves in the wrong direction, putting more people in prison.

#### State Measure 21
No. Rent control is well-intentioned (usually) but counterproductive. Nothing short of building more housing will solve our housing crisis.

#### State Measure 22
Not just no, but hell no! Sets a policy for Uber/Lyft drivers and other freelancers, and then would require a 7/8 majority to change it. WTF? That would never happen, meaning this rule would never, ever, ever change. For that reason alone it should be shot down. 

#### State Measure 23
No. Just a tool to make special interests richer.

#### State Measure 24
Yes. Expands protections for personal data.

#### State Measure 25
Cash bail reform. People shouldn't stay in jail just because they're poor or get out just because they're rich. This will change that.

#### United States President and Vice President
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Really? You got this far and you thought it would be anything else?
