Story from the Washington Post:

Emphasis added. So Ford claims his squadmates are doing bad things to
prisoners and his captain ships him off in restraints as a looney. The
captain gave Ford a chance to recant before having him locked up -- is
it any wonder more reports of torture didn't come out before Abu Ghraib?
How many soliders would have the courage and strength of character Ford
did and refuse to take back what they know is true?

That a single captain did this is reprehensible but understandable in a
world of imperfect people. He should be punished, but other than the
regrettable effect on Mr. Ford, it's not of huge consequence. What makes
it so significant is the way this Captain has been backed up through the
line of command. Nothing changed as a result of this case.

Both institutionally and personally, I suspect, once you pick up the
habit of torture it's hard to quit.
