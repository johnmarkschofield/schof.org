Title: Coffee Is For Closers
Date: 2001-02-01 00:00

I dance in waves of Limited Liability Companies  
visions of stock options swirling in my head as I  
work for frenzied hucksters  
with smiling faces and fuck-you eyes.

Polished liars who think "Glengarry Glen Ross" is a comedy  
and quote lines from it as often as "South Park."

Here it’s about sales.  
Moving product  
and what have you done for me this month?  
It’s about the cash and cars  
and trips to Vegas and  
strippers with high firm tits  
and flat stomachs.

Are you a closer?
