Title: Ceviché
Date: 1996-01-24 00:00

You sat next to me on the bus  
like a panther on the hunt;  
licking your lips at my taste:  
musty and stale like money  
but it was sweet to you.

Your tastes were familiar;  
but different  
than the women  
I had known.

Spicy with citrus tang  
like the ceviché  
you introduced me to  
at the restaurant  
I would never have discovered.

Ceviché is raw fish  
soaked in spicy lemon.  
I ordered it later  
at the seaside restaurant  
I found on my own.  
Sick for a week from that meal.

We took the bus to the beach –  
ordered coconuts overpriced  
milk and meat from  
fresh-split shell.  
Sweet and tangy like you.

I left you in Colima.  
I left before you discovered that  
not all Americans are rich.  
I left without saying goodbye.
