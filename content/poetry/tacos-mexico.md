Title: Tacos México
Date: 2001-01-01 00:00

I go to Tacos México at midnight — the one on Broadway past Ninth where
the Latino gangbangers don’t have much patience for the homeless black
vets who ask them for handouts and the for-rent girls from the
dance-hall down the block come by after a hard night of dry humping on
the dance floor or handjobs in dark corners for a hearty meal standing
up at the worn white counter of tacos o burros de lengua o asada o
cabeza o al pastor and then one of them will say something in Spanish
and I’ll respond in kind and they’ll all laugh at the white boy downtown
at night who speaks Spanish — but not making a point of it, you know,
they don’t want to be rude, and it’s been getting tougher there the last
year; not so many truckers pulling hard days nights with loads of
produce from Ventura bound for downtown markets; it’s all gangbangers
and whores now and I’ve never seen a harder man than Ramon the night
cook who clearly takes no shit from anyone and makes hot food with cold
eyes and a sharp cleaver at midnight on Broadway and the only thing I
can think of to say is "Dos burros al pastor. Con todo. Para llevar. Por
favor."
