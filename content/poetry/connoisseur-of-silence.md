Title: Connoisseur of Silence
Date: 2001-12-01 00:00

From the grip of fingers on a steering wheel;  
the line of a closed mouth;  
the precise angle of eyelashes —  
I can divine sorrow — anger — love — rage;  
all the varied flavors of silence.

I have been trained in this since birth;  
a disciple of a stern faith.  
I can express anger as I place my hands in my pockets;  
grief while buttoning my shirt;  
affection in the angle of my shoulders.

But other disciples are rare —  
I have never met a mistress of this faith —  
someone who can read "I love you" in the tilt of my head  
or "I am frightened" as I lace up my boots.
