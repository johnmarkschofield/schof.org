Just got back from [Larry Jaffe's](http://www.lgjaffe.com) "Another
West: Poets from Our Community" at the
Well's Fargo Theater in the [Autry Museum of Western
Heritage](http://theautry.org/). The night was a blast! Some
people might have been there for the "11-11 for 9-11" reading that Larry
hosted there on November 11 as a benefit for the victims of 9-11, but I
wasn't able to make it -- which made going there tonight a very pleasant
surprise. The Well's Fargo Theater is a 300-seat theater (I'm guessing)
with great acoustics and a great sound system. (Just not competing with
an espresso machine was exciting enough.) There were about 10 open
readers (There were actually more open readers, but Larry only selected
about 10 to perform. The night apparently has a strict time limit.) who
read one or two pieces each. There were some ups and downs with the open
readers, but in general it was an exceptionally good night of poetry.

Wayman Barnes and Frankie Drayus of
[LitRave](http://www.litrave.com) read. Frankie rocked. Wayman
rolled. (Yes, that's a compliment.) Alice Pero did a damn fine job on no
notice. Leslie Neal done herself proud. Larry Jaffe read "Unprotected
Poetry" which got a great response from the audience. Carmen Vega, one
of the features, did several pieces that demonstrated that she has an
absolutely tremendous singing voice.

The standout was Jerry Quickley, the evening's other feature, who did a
really solid set that moved the audience. I've been a fan of Jerry's
since he was reading at open mic's at the [Cobalt
Cafe](http://www.cobaltcafe.com/) in the early nineties,
and he's one of the most consistently good performance poets I've heard.

There were more than 100 people in attendance, which sounds like a lot
for a poetry reading, but they were so spread around the room that it
felt sparse and poorly attended. It wasn't until I actually looked
around and started counting heads that I realized how many people were
there. The audience, though not exactly what I would call electric, was
attentive and enthusiastic.

I read "[Walking Down
Winston](/2001/12/20/walking-down-winston/ "Walking DownÂ Winston"),"
which got a great response. A lot of people really seemed to like it. I
was glad they enjoyed it, but I wasn't entirely happy with my
performance. I was kind of running on autopilot -- there are parts of
the poem I don't even remember reading. I may have given a good
performance (I'm not sure) but if I did, it was a mechanically good
performance. I definitely wasn't feeling the reality of the words I was
reading.

The accoustics were good enough that I don't think I needed the
microphone -- but I kind of regret not using it, since it was a good mic
in a good room with a professional at the sound board. Still, I need to
get much better with a mic before I'll feel as comfortable as I do just
projecting to the room.

Another problem I'm trying to solve with this poem and several others is
related to audience reaction. There's a couple of lines in "Walking Down
Winston" that are just damn funny -- and I'm puzzling how to give people
permission and space to laugh without stepping on the poem or seeming
like I'm more of a comedian than a poet. If they catch the laugh I'll
pause and let it go by, but sometimes it really seems like they're
afraid to laugh.

I'm definitely planning to go back. It was a good night. Larry should be
proud.
