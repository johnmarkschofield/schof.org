Title: What does silence look like?

New poem. Definitely not finished. Might take the last two paragrams
and turn them into a new poem.

Everything I see makes a sound; what does silence look like?  
We have no yardstick, no block of iridium one meter long;  
we know absolute zero but without vacuum there is no absolute silence;  
no stick exactly nothing long;  
we measure noise but not its absence;  
sound but not its consequence  
silence there is none.  
Listen to the varied sounds we call silence.  

Even this building makes noise; were it quiet enough to hear them were
the cars and the trucks and the voices and the radios and the steps made
silent; we would hear the soft thwack thwack thwack thwack of the
metal-turbaned vent spinning; the creak and groan of metal growing and
shrinking throughout the day, and have I mentioned that electricity
hummmmmmmmmmmmms?

You could hear your own heart beating if everything else would just shut
the fuck up!

But sometimes you hear a melody in this cacophony or a rhythm that
catches you; individual elements that stand out like a soprano in a
barbershop quartet; the throaty, pitched-to-carry "tamales, tamales,
tamales" I hear every morning from seven to nine; the pigeons that
terrified beat all at once past my window; their wings like a maddened
brush-using percussionist. Melodious Spanish with a back-beat of
percussive Korean; Nortenos from car windows blending with Asian music I
can't identify from an open shop door.
