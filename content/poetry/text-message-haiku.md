Title: Text Message Haiku
Date: 2003-01-01 00:00

From 2000 to 2003 I was a computer consultant in Southern California,
covering a territory of Irvine to Oxnard. (If you don't know Southern
California, that's a LONG stretch of road.) I coped by composing haiku
and sending them to friends as text messages.

Traffic stalled.  
The mind wanders to green fields.  
I move 20 feet.

White pickup in front  
Sign says "Corrosion Fixer."  
Contemplate for hours.

Driving past a train  
Nasty tank cars; toxic spills.  
Hobos have it tough.

Vanity License  
Essence captured in metal  
Not very likely

Inflatable things  
Car dealer's giant baby  
Eye-catching but dumb

Ninety miles an hour  
Almost clipped my fender  
Wish there were a cop

Small bedroom window  
seven feet from the freeway.  
Somebody lives there?

So many SUVs.  
An army of 4-wheel drive.  
The freeway ain't dirt.

Stop your damn honking.  
You want me to levitate?  
I can't go faster.

Traffic @ dead stop  
Relaxation technique not working  
"Happy place" my ass.
