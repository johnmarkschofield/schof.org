Went to the reading at Midnight Special
Bookstore yesterday. It's interesting how each
reading has a different character, even when some of the same people
attend. The MS has has a generally older crowd of readers -- with the
average age in the 50's or higher -- with a surprisingly young crowd of
listeners. The emphasis seems to lean more towards writing than
performing -- not that the performance is flat, but more quiet and
scholarly. All in all it was a good night, with some quite-skilled
poets. I did "[Walking Down
Winston](/2001/12/20/walking-down-winston "Walking Down Winston")."
I felt quite good about the reading, and got a lot of positive feedback.
Now I just need to write more poems that are as strong.

After the reading, the host (Reverend Dave) had a mini-reading at his
tiny apartment on the beach by the Santa Monica Pier. We crammed far too
many people into his bedroom/living room, passed around the beer and the
snacks, and had a rockin' good time. Each person read one or two poems
(there seemed to be no set policy, but nobody abused the room) and then
passed the baton off to someone else. I read "[Tacos
México](/2001/01/01/tacos-mexico "Tacos México")" as
the first poem of the evening, which got a great response, and "[The Sum
Of
Tears](/2001/03/04/the-sum-of-tears "The Sum Of Tears"),"
which didn't get as good a response. I attribute that to the lateness of
the hour. (And I wasn't feeling the poem when I read it. It felt like I
was acting rather than speaking the piece honestly. Man, this poetry
shit is really tough to do well consistently.) Still, the reading at the
Reverend's was a hell of a lot of fun. There was something really sweet
about it.
