I held my wife's hand  
as the needle went into her  
seven-months pregnant belly.  
  
Two days before:  
Your baby's not breathing.  
Your baby's not swallowing.  
Your baby's not moving.  
And a baby who does not  
breathe  
or swallow  
or move  
does not start doing those things once born.  
We'll give you some time to think.  
  
I held my wife's hand as the needle went in.  
Seven months of belly kisses.  
Playing music,  
dancing,  
talking,  
all for the belly. All to the belly.  
  
All gone.  
  
I held my wife's hand when they induced labor.  
When the contractions started.  
When the epidural went in.  
  
I held little Holly in my hands.  
Still warm from her mother.  
But not moving.  
Not breathing.  
Slowly cooling.  
  
There's some of Holly's ashes  
buried under a tree we planted  
in the back yard. Holly's tree.  
  
But most of her ashes  
are in a box.  
In a closet.  
In our house.  
Because we couldn't bear to part with them.  
Couldn't bear to let them go.  
  
Couldn't let them out of our hands.
