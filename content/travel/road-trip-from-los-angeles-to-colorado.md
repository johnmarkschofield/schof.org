Around New Year (2000 -\> 2001) I didn't have much going on, so I hit
the road in my trusty Toyota 4Runner -- took a week or so off of work
and drove from Los Angeles to Colorado and back. It was a wonderful
trip, and I saw some amazing things -- most of which I didn't capture
through my lens. Here's three I did:

I took some [pictures of a building burning](/2014/12/26/arizona-building-fire) down in Arizona on the same trip.
