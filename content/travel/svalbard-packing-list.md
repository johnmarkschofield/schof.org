Title: Sailing To Svalbard -- Packing List

In June of 2022, I will sail from Tromsó in northern Norway to Longyearbyen, in the Svalbard archipelago, Norway. Both Tromsó and Longyearbyen are above the Arctic Circle, and at that time of year, the sun will not go down for the entire trip. I will be a crew member on [Isbjórn](https://www.59-north.com/isbjorn), a 1922 Swan 48. It's fitting that Isbjórn and I were born in the same year -- I'll turn 50 shortly after this trip ends.

[These guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci6xWTKkhRo) also sailed from Northern Norway to Svalbard, but they're considerably more athletic than I am.

I'm now preparing my packing list, to make sure I have everything I need to stand watch in the cockpit of a sailboat above the Arctic Circle. I've never even been skiing, so this has been a bit of a journey. I will probably regret some of these choices.
