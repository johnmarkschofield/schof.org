On my way back during my
[road trip from Los Angeles to Colorado](/2012/08/03/road-trip-from-los-angeles-to-colorado)
I saw a pillar of smoke in the distance. Driving towards it I saw a building fully-engulfed 
in flames in this small town, with hardly anyone around it.

People started gathering, and after a few minutes the local Volunteer Fire Department
arrived and started putting it out.

I was really struck by how isolated and dangerous small-town living can be. At home
in Los Angeles you can count on a fast response from a professional, on-duty fire
department. In this case, the fire was burning for something like 20 minutes before
they were able to get anything larger than a garden hose pouring water on it.
