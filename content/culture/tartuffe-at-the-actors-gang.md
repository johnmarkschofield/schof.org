I went to see *Tartuffe* last night at [The Actor's
Gang](http://www.theactorsgang.com/) with Becca H., Rick P. and Megan.
Becca's trip back to LA was the impetus for the show -- I'm not the
biggest Moliere fan in the world, and I didn't really have my hopes up
about the show.

I should have known better. I've stage-managed for Jon Kellam before at
the [theater company we helped found](http://zoodistrict.org), and
Killer Kellam **always** puts on a strong, high-energy show. Tartuffe
was no different. There wasn't a bad actor on stage, and not a false
note uttered. Bosco Flannigan's lighting design was excellent, the
costumes and live music were great, and I loved the set.

There were a couple of scenes that lagged, and the play is about three
hours -- but there were many scenes so funny I howled. If I'd been
drinking milk it would have been spraying out my nose. All in all, well
worth a visit -- even with a ticket price of \$25.

Incidentally, I think there's only about ten people in LA theater, and I
know seven of them. Ran into several people I knew from [Zoo
District](http://zoodistrict.org), plus a clown (not an insult; it's his
craft) I worked with on a Blue Girl show at the El Rey theater about 6
years ago.
