Title: Whatâ€™s up with the gay agenda?
Date: 2005-03-14 18:21

And by "gay agenda" I'm talking about the Republicans. What's their
obsession with gay sex? It seems obvious to someone as dumb as a chimp
that it's just about picking on a convenient target.

I've been trying to figure out how any of this makes marriage or family
or apple pie any weaker, and haven't been able to.

Let's say you live in a mid-sized Midwestern town. Say a gay couple
moves in down the block. How does that diminish you? Many on the Right
say they're not against homosexuals -- just people who perform
homosexual acts. But even if you're an "all gays go to Hell" type,
what's the big deal? It's not like they're having sex on their front
porch. If they do, that's indecent exposure and a dozen other violations
as well that have nothing to do with gayness -- that's not the problem.
If Bob and Mark are having sex (you don't know) they're doing it in
their bedroom, with the blinds drawn. What's your problem? If your kids
ask, just say they're roommates.

Is your marriage going to disolve because of this? Will your children
start howling at the moon? Your wife leave you for a female tennis pro?
You become a hairdresser? Didn't think so.
