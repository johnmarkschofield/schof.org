Experience

CISCO	Pasadena, CA
DevOps Engineer II	October 2014 ?ÿPresent

* Worked in the Rackspace Private Cloud group, providing on-premises and cloud-based OpenStack private cloud solutions.
* Worked as part of a team re-implementing the Chef-based automation infrastructure that Rackspace previously used in Ansible, using LXC to encapsulate the various OpenStack services.
* Wrote scripts to do end-to-end automation of deployment of test clusters using Rackspace cloud servers.


CITRUSBYTE, LLC.	Encino, California (Remote)
Senior DevOps Engineer	October 2013 ?ÿMay 2014
* Citrusbyte is a consultancy with clients including Disney, AT&T, Fox, Sony, and Nike.
* I was the sole DevOps Engineer for the AT&T mHealth project, as well as being a resource for technical escalation for other Citrusbyte projects.
* Managed DevOps for mHealth using Ruby, Chef, BASH scripting, and Vagrant virtual machines for testing.
* AT&T mHealth runs on AT&T?s internal OpenStack data centers.

DAKIM, INC.	Santa Monica, California
Senior DevOps Engineer	August 2005ÿ?ÿOctober 2013
* Dakim produces software used to provide brain-fitness exercises to seniors worried about developing Alzheimer?s Disease and those suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer?s. This software is available on the web, using custom Linux-based touch-screen computers, and through installable Windows and OS X software.
* As employee #2, built the IT department from the ground up. 
* Supervised a team of 13, including five developers, five QA Engineers, two first-level Technical Support Engineers, and an internal Desktop Support person. 
* Team has had very low voluntary turnover and high morale from the beginning, and I have maintained high hiring standards as the team grew.
* Selected, championed, and implemented many process improvements at Dakim, including setting up a bug-tracking system, version control, and a wiki for internal documentation.
* Created standards and procedures for external support, internal support, crisis management, and QA Lab management that have reduced operational costs and complexity, increased flexibility, and promoted efficient communication and problem solving.
* Taught internal classes in Linux system administration and beginning Python programming, and presented to trade and user groups on BASH command-line use.
* Wrote a simple, efficient, and fast software- and content-update mechanism for Dakim?s installable software product. Written in Python, it runs reliably on Windows, OS X, and Linux computers, downloading eight GB of content in 65,000 audio, movie, and graphic files at close to wire-speed, and upgrading or downgrading software versions seamlessly.
* Responsible for all systems administration tasks across a network of more than 750 Dakim Linux devices and several dozen Linux, Windows, and OS X servers. 
* Created a stripped-down version of Ubuntu Linux and designed and implemented a software- and content-update mechanism based on rsync and Debian?s apt package management system; the system provides seamless unattended updates of devices in almost 40 states and three countries. All units need to operate on (sometimes poorly-configured) client networks while requiring minimal or no client configuration changes.
* Implemented a content-management system for Dakim?s website using Django and Mezzanine and deployed it to Heroku using Heroku-Fu, an open-source deployment tool I created.
* Worked directly with the General Counsel to evaluate technical and business portions of contracts with clients and vendors, and write drafts of technically relevant sections of Dakim contracts.

* Implemented a full backup solution for the multiple terabytes of data The Icon processed monthly, implemented training procedures for retouching and production staff, added file servers, and streamlined retouching and production workflows. 
* Identified and closed gaping security holes in FTP and web servers and rewrote procedures to eliminate shared passwords, physically accessible servers, and other major security issues.
* Increased on-site RAID-protected storage from 3 to 15 terabytes, and implemented on-site data protection and safety changes, including adding fire detection and suppression equipment to the server room, and managing a project to increase air conditioning capacity and repair incorrectly installed air conditioning systems in the server room.
* Replaced the existing DSL Internet connection with redundant T1 and microwave wireless connections, with failover and load balancing provided by a Radware Linkproof, and collaborated with The Icon?s subsidiary, The Bridge to streamline workflow and eliminate problems in their mobile van-based digital capture service.
