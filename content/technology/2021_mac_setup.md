I like to take notes when I set up a new computer for myself. I just bought one of the new M1 Macbook Pro laptops, so now's as good a time as any to update my checklist.

* 1password (install from download, not App Store, and do not sign up for their web service. Sync via iCloud.)
* Dropbox (Direct Download)
* iTerm2 (Direct Download)
* Microsoft Office (Direct Download) (Word, Excel, Powerpoint only)
* OmniFocus (direct download)
* Xcode command-line tools (by typing “git” in the terminal).
* Sublime Text 3 (config is stored in dropbox; direct download)
* Mailmate Direct Download
* Set up SSH by copying keys from 1password.
* Homebrew (Standard Install)
* Brew install tree
* Brew install hub
* Brew install vagrant (Useless without VMWare Fusion or VirtualBox)
* Brew install virtualbox (Does not work on M1 Macs)
* Parallels for virtualization (allows you to virtualize an ARM linux) (Using QEMU solution below.)
* Evernote (Mac App Store)
* Deliveries (Mac App Store)
* Install home-brew
* Compile and install QEMU using above web page. Later updates broke this.
* Evernote Web Clipper (Mac App Store)
* Discord (Mac App Store; Sigh)
* Slack (Direct Download; Sigh)
* Zoom (Direct Download;  Sigh)
* IINA media player
* Synergy (Sigh)
* Moom (<https://manytricks.com/moom/>)
