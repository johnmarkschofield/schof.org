Title: A More Balanced "For The Bosses" Email About The Heartbleed Vulnerability

Last night I wrote an email advising a client about the
[Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/) vulnerability and its impact on
operations. I'm posting that here, as it's a little more balanced and
professional (and better written) than [the blog entry I wrote last
night](/2014/04/07/heartbleed-openssl-vulnerability-and-ubuntu-12-04-precise-servers "Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability and Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Servers").
Of course I've omitted names to protect my clients' privacy. (And I
asked permission before publishing this.)


On April 7, 2014, the OpenSSL project released a security advisory for a
vulnerability called CVE-2014-0160 (aka "Heartbleed").

-   <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt>
-   <https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160>
-   A great writeup from some of the researchers who discovered the
    vulnerability can be found at <http://heartbleed.com/>

This is a newly-announced vulnerability. The following is based on our
reading of the security advisory and related information. Further
information on this topic is becoming available rapidly, and we will
update you as we get new facts and as our understanding of the facts
changes.

OpenSSL is the tool that provides secure connections to websites. It's
what makes https:// connections work properly. Our project uses OpenSSL
to secure the public's connections to our web servers.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specially-crafted packet
to OpenSSL, and receive a dump of up to 64KB of the server's memory.
Because the attacker can send multiple packets each requesting a
different 64KB chunk of the server's memory, in effect the attacker can
read the entire memory (RAM) of the server.

The vulnerable versions of OpenSSL (1.0.1 and 1.0.2) were released in
March 2012, and all versions released between then and today are
vulnerable to this attack. These versions are very widely-distributed.
(Including on Ubuntu 12.04 Server, the operating system we use for the
our servers.)

Because this is an attack that a very large number of servers on the
Internet are vulnerable to, it is likely that this attack will be
quickly "weaponized" so that unskilled attackers can use it in an
automated fashion. At present, only highly-skilled attackers can use it.

We have verified using <http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/> that our project
is vulnerable to this attack.

All of this lends a great deal of urgency to the update and remediation
process:

1.  The very first step is to update the version of OpenSSL on our
    servers to the latest version, released today. This can be done
    quickly and easily, and should be done as soon as possible. It is
    extremely likely that there will be no service interruption (other
    than on each server as it is updated) resulting from this update.
2.  Once the servers have been updated, they are no longer vulnerable to
    this attack. However, attackers could be in possession of private
    information that they copied off the server before OpenSSL was
    updated. (It appears that security researchers have been aware of
    this issue since December 2013, but attackers could have been using
    this attack any time from March 2012 to the present.)
3.  The following information should definitely be revoked and reissued:
    1.   SSL Certificates
    2.   VPN Certificates (VPN also uses SSL)

Until these certificates are revoked and reissued, we have to assume
that attackers can eavesdrop on and modify the HTTPS/SSL traffic of our
customers reaching our website, and of our VPN traffic.

Anything that has been in RAM on the server, even briefly, should be
revoked and reissued. Our developers will have to study the issue to
determine what needs to be revoked. However, a partial list of things
that **may** have been in memory and **may** have been compromised
includes:

1.   End-user usernames and passwords
2.   API keys
3.   Passwords and authentication certificates to internal and external
     services, including our databases and monitoring services.

We are not aware at this time if any Intrusion Detection System or
network monitoring can detect this attack. This attack does not show up
in OpenSSL or system logs.
