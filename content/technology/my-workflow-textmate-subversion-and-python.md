Title: My Workflow: TextMate, Subversion, and Python

I'm focusing in on some very important parts of my workflow. Version
control is Subversion. I'm most of the way through the book on it.

Text editing is TextMate. I was trying to use vim, because it's one
editor I can use both on my OS X desktop and SSH'd across the network to
linux boxes. I will continue to use vim remotely -- though I may look at
emacs as well. But for local editing, it's TextMate for sure. Its
functionality when dealing with large source code files and trees with
many different files is impressive -- I can see myself working
significantly more efficiently with TextMate.

I'm used to working on the command-line with Subversion, but TextMate
integrates with it, so I can commit changes by hotkey, etc.

And Python is rapidly becoming my system administration language of
choice. All of this seems to fit together really well.
