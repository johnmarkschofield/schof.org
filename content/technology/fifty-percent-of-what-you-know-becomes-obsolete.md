Title: 50% of What You Know Becomes Obsolete Every 18 Months

As a guy who gets paid only because of his computer knowledge, the
following paragraph is a bit of a comfort to me:

> One of the many consequences of the exponential power-versus-time
> curve in computing, and the corresponding pace of software
> development, is that 50% of what one knows becomes obsolete over every
> 18 months. Unix does not abolish this phenomenon, but does do a good
> job of containing it. There's a bedrock of unchanging basics —
> languages, system calls, and tool invocations — that one can actually
> keep using for years, even decades. Elsewhere it is impossible to
> predict what will be stable; even entire operating systems cycle out
> of use. Under Unix, there is a fairly sharp distinction between
> transient knowledge and lasting knowledge, and one can know ahead of
> time (with about 90% certainty) which category something is likely to
> fall in when one learns it. Thus the loyalty Unix commands.

It's from Eric Raymond's book, [The Art of Unix
Programming](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/index.html) in
his "[The Durability of
Unix](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s02.html)"
chapter.
