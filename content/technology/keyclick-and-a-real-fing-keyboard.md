Title: "Keyclick" and a Real F'ing Keyboard
Date: 2007-08-06 21:29

I first heard about the Unicomp reincarnations of the original IBM
"clicky" keyboard on Mark Pilgrim's sadly defunct site. I've long been a fan of IBM keyboards -- I used to pick them up at
thrift stores. If you bought three you could usually end up with two
working keyboards. But they all had the HUGE keyboard connectors -- the
predecessor to PS/2 connectors -- and weren't USB compatible without a
lot of soldering. I moved on to inferior alternatives.

But then came Mark Pilgrim, and my introduction to Unicomp. I now have a
[$70 Unicomp
keyboard](http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/customizer.html "Unicomp Real Keyboard")
at home and one in the office, and it's GOLDEN. It's like typing on
chocolate. (But, you know, without the mess. And with clickiness.)

But the click is much more than JUST the sound -- the reason I love
these keyboards is the tactile and audio feedback I get when I type. You
KNOW when it's registered a keypress -- something that you do NOT know
instantly on a mushy keyboard.

It's loud, though. My computer is in my bedroom, and my girlfriend can't
sleep when I'm typing, even with earplugs.

All of this, by the way, leads up to my puzzlement about an [article in
TidBITS](http://db.tidbits.com/article/9102 "TidBITS article on Keyclick").
Apparently the author is a big fan of clicky keyboards, but rather than
get one, he's raving about a [software
utility](http://www.sustworks.com/site/prod_keyclick_overview.html "Keyclick makes noise while you type")
that clicks the speakers every time you hit a key.

I can see -- sort of -- why you'd want that, but as the owner of a
Unicomp keyboard, I get to look down on that sort of kludge. Seems to me
you're missing out on the best part of the keyboard (the tactile
response) and emphasizing the sound, a less important part of why the
keyboard works so well. (Although, I must admit I like it when I'm on a
roll typing and it sounds like I'm operating a chainsaw.) Still, there's
not much you can do about tactile response in software -- this may be
the only part of the problem they could fix.
