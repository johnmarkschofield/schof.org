People who have known me for a while are slightly puzzled. Why am I
semi-consistently using my middle name now, when I never did before?
Sudden attack of pretentiousness? Actually, no. When you Google for
"[John
Schofield](http://www.google.com/search?q=john+schofield "Google results for "),"
I'm WAY down on the list -- not even on the first page. (Some Civil War
General gets all the link love.) So now I'm [John Mark
Schofield](http://www.google.com/search?q=john+mark+schofield "Google Results for John Mark Schofield"),
which gets a LOT more Google juice. (At this time, I'm #1 on the
results.)
