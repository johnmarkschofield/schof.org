I recently found a great feature of [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/). Let's say you have tabular data, and you need to make the same edit to each line. This happens to me quite often.

Select the entire text, then choose Selection --> Split Into Lines. This gives you a cursor on each line in the selection.

Hit CTRL-A to move to the start of each line, then DEL to delete the prefix on each line. Then CTRL-E to move the cursor on each line to the end, and then the Backspace key to delete the ending on each line at the time time. You're left with the part of the line that you need. Sweet!
