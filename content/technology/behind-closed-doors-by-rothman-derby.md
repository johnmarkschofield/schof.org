"[Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of Great
Management](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976694026/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0976694026&linkCode=as2&tag=schoforg-20)"
by Johanna Rothman and Esther Derby is a strange book; while not having
any ideas that are really NEW to anyone who's read the other management
books I've recommended, BCD still manages to impress and be worth
reading. It does this by having lots of small, practical advice for
managers, in lots and lots of different areas.

If you read the other books in the field, will you derive most of these
ideas yourself? Probably. But I still got a few good techniques from
this book -- among them, a new approach to what BCD calls my "Project
Portfolio" -- my lists of projects, tasks, and who they're assigned to.

Worth reading. Not worth reading first, but worth the time and money
spent on it.
