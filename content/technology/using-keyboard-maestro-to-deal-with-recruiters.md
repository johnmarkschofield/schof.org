Title: Using Keyboard Maestro to Deal With Recruiters

If you're a geek like I am, you get a few emails from recruiters a day,
and a few calls a week. This tip helps deal with the emails and
Linked-In connection requests. It doesn't help with the calls. (The
"send to voicemail" button on my phone works for that, as well as
directly asking recruiters not to cold-call me when I accidentally
answer their calls.)

In all cases, I'm polite and respectful, but firm. Recruiters are just
trying to do their jobs. In an economy where the [real unemployment rate
is about 12%](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101810685), getting pestered by
people who want to hire you is a fricking privilege, not something to
complain about!

But since I'm not looking for a job, I want to 1) spend as little time
dealing with recruiters as possible, and 2) not burn bridges. Here's
what I do:

In [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/), I set up
the macro "recruiterreply;" to insert the following text:

> Thanks very much for your interest! I'm happy and well-compensated at
> my present job, and I'm not interested in a new position at this time.
>
> Let's keep in touch anyway. You can feel free to connect with me on
> LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/schof or visit
> http://schof.org/resume to view my resume.
>
> Please note that all my friends in this field already have jobs, and I
> can not refer any of them to you.
>
> Thanks very much!  
>  John Schofield

That last paragraph is an important addition, as it eliminates the
inevitable follow-up email from recruiters asking for leads.

Here's what that macro looks like in Keyboard Maestro:

I don't feel bad at all in sending a boilerplate reply to recruiters, as
most of them are simply doing mass-mailings to Linked-In accounts that
match the keywords they are looking for.

If the recruiter actually wrote something that indicates that they read
my resume or profile and have a clue who I actually am, I'll add a
sentence or two to personalize my reply.

This way I handle emailed communication from recruiters without any
frustration, and without spending much time on it.
