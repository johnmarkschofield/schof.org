Title: A funny thing happened on the way to the URL

[Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) is a hip, cutting-edge
bookmark-handling service. It lets you share bookmarks with other people
in a number of ways that are much more powerful than they appear at
first. It's elegant and easy to use.

I never use it. I use [Furl.net](http://furl.net) instead, a service
that, while adequate, has none of the excitement or polish of
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/).

I often read [John Robb's weblog](http://jrobb.mindplex.org/), and I
came across this [excerpt](http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2005/02/10.html)
from [Chris Serjak's blog](http://serjak.blogspot.com/):

> A trip with DynCorps is the proverbial "E-ticket" ride. We mount up in
> 3 heavily armored Suburbans with all the passengers in one SUV, known
> as the "limo". The other two trucks are filled with PSDs, carrying
> AK-47s, M-4s, SAWs, grenades, and handguns. On our way out of the IZ,
> we rendezvous with two armored Humvees equipped with turret mounted
> 50-cal machine guns. And before we hit the streets of Baghdad, you
> hear the thump, thump, thump of our helicopter air support. Two small
> civilian-style black helicopters fly low over head, scouting our route
> and watching our flanks from above. At times, they'll swoop low enough
> to kick up rotor wash and you'll hear pebbles pinging off the SUVs.
>
> Even before we leave the Green Zone, we're doing extreme defensive
> driving. As we approach other cars, the lead vehicles will force the
> cars to the right while the limo swerves to the left. Rather than
> stop, or even slow, for intersections, we just hit our sirens and,
> again, the lead vehicles will set a screen while we charge through.
> Once we clear the military checkpoints, everything is fair game.
> Apparently, it's a lot easier to clear a path through traffic when
> you're facing it head-on. Thus, we seem to prefer the north-bound
> lanes for trips to southern Baghdad.
>
> Our lead Humvee's job is to clear a path for us which he does by
> waving an assault rifle at anyone that gets too close. If that doesn't
> get their attention, his favorite weapon seems to be half-liter water
> bottles. He tosses these like a Nolan Ryan fastball at the windshield
> of cars that don't pull to the side of the road quickly enough in his
> estimation. He actually has a little rack of water bottles mounted
> inside the turret.
>
> The remaining vehicles in the convoy fly along over 60mph, often
> swerving to, I assume, prevent someone from accurately targeting us.
> We're rarely more than a couple meters from the rear bumper of the

> hear the thump, thump, thump of the helicopters as they skim over the
> top of you. One of the more exciting things to see is one of these

> 6 feet off the highway.

That excerpt was pretty mind-blowing, and I clicked through to Chris
Serjak's blog, and read the entire entry and there were a few more
paragraphs than Robb had quoted, and it was really interesting. I saved
it in del.icio.us, and came back the next day. And saw this:

> Nothing Happening  
>  Note: Our security office has recommended that I delete this post.

That day I switched to Furl. Furl keeps a copy of the pages that I save,
in a cache on Furl's servers, and even if they're deleted on the
original server they stay on Furl's server. I wish I'd switched earlier.
I fully support Chris' (or anyone's) right to publish or not publish
information on their own site, but I wanted to reread his writing -- I
was pissed. Mostly at myself, for not saving his entry.

Incidentally, [the
following](http://serjak.blogspot.com/2005/03/telling-truth.html) was on
Chris Serjak's blog recently:

Not to take credit away from you, Chris, but the rumor might also have
gotten started by one of the dozens or hundreds of Iraqi drivers who got
beaned with water bottles. Just saying.
