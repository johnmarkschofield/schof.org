Title: Using Keyboard Maestro to Log to Evernote

I need to submit a daily log of what I've accomplished to my job. But I
find it hard to keep track sometimes, and I feel like I've forgotten
things I should be putting on that list. (Yes, yes, OCD, I know.)

I found the [Log To
Evernote](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/third-party-actions#LogToEvernote)
[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) action, and created
a simple Keyboard Maestro macro Â to prompt for a category and a text
string of what I accomplished, and save them to an Evernote Text Note.
Since Evernote and Keyboard Maestro are synced, this automatically works
on my desktop and my laptop.

Here's what the entry screen looks like:

And here's what the Evernote log looks like:

__Update 2014-12-31__: Seems like the Log To Evernote plugin no longer works for me in the latest versions of OS X and Evernote. I'm investigating, at a low priority. Until I resolve it, I'm tagging this post "Obsolete."
