Title: Linux Is Good

There's a command in Linux / Unix called "sudo" which temporarily gives
a normal user the power of the root user. In non-geek mixed metaphors,
instead of having limited access, you have a backstage pass which lets
you do absolutely anything on the system. (Of course, the command needs
a password, so not just anybody on the system can run sudo and become
root.) When you use the sudo command for the first time, it prints out
the following message:


    We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

    Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.

    #2) Think before you type.

    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

Something about that just strikes me as cool. You'd never see a message
like that in a Microsoft product.
