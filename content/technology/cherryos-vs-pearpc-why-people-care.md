Title: CherryOS vs. PearPC: Why People Care

There's an excellent
article at
DrunkenBlog showing a damning pile of
evidence that the commercial product CherryOS
contains stolen code from the [PearPC](http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/)
project and a number of other open-source projects. (Ed. note: Broken links in the previous sentence have been removed.) What's more, their
marketing claims appear to differ so markedly from the reality of their
product that they could be subject to a suit from their customers.
Here's the background:

The performance issue is fairly simple -- the CherryOS folks claim their
software runs at a certain speed, just about everyone who knows anything
about the subject says it's impossible for their software to run that
fast, and CherryOS has not yet proven their claims. I don't know how
many $50 copies of their software have been sold, but so far not one
customer has come forward to say his software works as advertised
despite the controversy.

The "stolen code" issue needs a little more background. We'll be
discussing the differences between two different types of software
today -- open and closed source. Closed-source programs, also known as
proprietary or commercial programs, are the type of software you're
probably used to if you own a Windows or Macintosh computer. A single
company writes it, hiring programmers, renting an office, and owning the
code. They do not release the source code to the public -- it's
considered a trade secret -- and they charge you money if you want to
use their software. Think programs like Quicken, Microsoft Office,
Windows, etc.

Open source software is different. It's written by groups of programmers
spread all over the world, who communicate electronically and
collaborate to build software projects that they let people use. Anyone
can look at the source code, anyone can take and modify the source code.
The only restriction the authors insist on is that if you make any
changes to the code, you must release your changes to the public as
well. ([This is grossly
oversimplified.](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html)) That way
everybody benefits -- the original authors get improvements to programs
that they use, without having to write them -- and everyone else gets
the benefit of a better product as well. This requirement is part of a
software license -- almost all programs have a license.

Programs like Microsoft word have licenses that say you can not make
copies of the software and give them to other people -- and Open Source
software has licenses that say "You can give this to other people or
make changes to it as long as you do these other things that we want."
Either type of license is enforceable in court. If you buy a copy of
Microsoft Office and then give a copy to a friend, Microsoft could sue
you in court for damages. Similarly, if a commercial company takes open
source code and includes it in a commercial product without giving away
their modifications, they can be sued by the original source code's
authors.

The problem is that it's generally not big corporations releasing open
source programs. It's individuals doing this in the evening from their
dens or garages or bedrooms. They don't have the resources to sue
another company.

At least, that's apparently what the makers of Cherry OS thought. If you
read the DrunkenBlog article above you'll find a damning technical explanation (quite
readable even if you're not that technical) of the similarities between
Cherry OS and a number of open-source projects. The makers of Cherry OS
continue to deny that any code was stolen, and maintain their accusers
are mistaken. Based on the mounting evidence, Cherry OS has a lot of
explaining to do. I hope they get to do it in court.
