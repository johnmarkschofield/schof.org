Last week a friend asked what podcasts I listen to, and I thought it might be useful to list the podcasts and YouTube channels I subscribe to.

## Finance & Real Estate Podcasts

* [The Fort with Chris Powers](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fort-with-chris-powers/id1410549811): Great interviews with business and real estate people. Amazing guests. Chris is a prolific podcaster, so I find I have to be ruthless about skipping episodes on subjects that aren't central to my interests.

## Technology Podcasts

* [Mac Power Users](https://www.relay.fm/mpu): I use a Mac daily, and being productive on a Mac is basically my entire job. Spending some time getting better at the basics (and learning about cool new tools I can use) is worth my time.

* [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm): I've been listening to these guys for years, and now it seems like they're part of the family. A weird, tech-obsessed, and very critical family, but still. The podcast is three friends discussing Apple technology and the related ecosystem. Come for the insightful analysis of the Apple ecosystem; stay for the inside jokes and shit-giving.
