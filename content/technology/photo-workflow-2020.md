It's my strong preference to use only open standards to keep my important data. I don't want to end up with the equivalent of orphaned word processor documents that can't be opened anymore.

For my document storage, I use PDFs stored by year and month in directories. All metadata is stored in the file name itself (there is no central database). That will work on Mac or Windows or Linux now and in the future. If at some point PDF no longer remains the document storage standard, there will be ample tools to translate PDF to the new dominant standard.

I wish I could do the same with my photographs, but that doesn't seem to be possible at the moment. Right now, Apple's Photos app is the best choice for me. It supports my primary camera, my iPhone, superbly. Images are stored inside the Photos Library in standard image formats, so if I need to abandon Photos, my data can be transitioned to some new choice. Accessing the files directly in this manner would lose metadata stored in Photos. The best choice is to migrate away from Photos when a new storage tools becomes dominant so the migration tools will be well-tested and well-supported.
