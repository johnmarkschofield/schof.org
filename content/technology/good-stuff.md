First off, Robert X. Cringely wrote a recent
[column](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20031023.html) on the
comparative strengths of Linux and Windows. Here's a neat quote from the
article attributed to Linus Torvalds:

> "Because the software is free,
> there is no pressure to release it before it is really ready just to
> achieve some sales target. Every version of Linux is declared to be
> finished only when it is actually finished, which explains why it is so
> solid. The other reason why free software is better is because the

> you are making something to give away to the world, something that
> represents to millions of users your philosophy of computing, you will
> always make it the very best product you can make. That's the reason why
> Linux is a
> success."
