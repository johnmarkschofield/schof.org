One of the most important parts of setting up a new computer (for a geek
like me) is getting the Terminal set up right. I spend a lot of time
there. [I wrote about this in
2006](/2006/05/02/my-not-the-perfect-os-x-terminal-setup/ "My (Not The) Perfect OS X TerminalÂ Setup"),
and I think it's time to update my Terminal setup notes for Lion.

I've noted the things I changed from the Terminal's default settings.

Terminal --\> Preferences --\> Settings:

-   Duplicate "Pro" to a theme called "Schof"
-   Make Schof the default

Terminal --\> Preferences --\> Settings --\> Text:

-   Check "Antialias text"
-   Check "Blink cursor"
-   Font -\> Monaco 12 pt.

Terminal --\> Preferences --\> Settings --\> Window:

-   Background color to 100% opacity

Terminal --\> Preferences --\> Settings --\> Shell --\> "When the Shell
Exits" select "Close if the shell exited cleanly."

Terminal --\> Preferences --\> Settings --\> Advanced: Declare terminal
as: "xterm-color"
