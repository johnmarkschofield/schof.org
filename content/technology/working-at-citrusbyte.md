I'm incredibly excited to be working at
[Citrusbyte](http://citrusbyte.com). I'm not sure how much I can say
about how they work, but I know I can say this: They do their best to
work according to the video and blog posts on this "[How Github
Works](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works/)" page.

I remember reading those posts about how "work" works at Github -- how
they don't measure by hours worked, and they optimize for programmer
happiness. And I remember thinking that I wouldn't get that good a
working environment anywhere I worked.

I was wrong. Citrusbyte isn't perfect (they have to have some
compromises to fit how their clients work) but in general, they fit that
Github model pretty closely.

I'm feeling incredibly excited and lucky to be there.
