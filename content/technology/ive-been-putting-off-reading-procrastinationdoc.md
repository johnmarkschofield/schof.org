I downloaded a file called procrastination.doc from
[43folders](http://www.43folders.com/) or
[Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com) or one of the other personal
productivity sites I follow. It's been sitting on my desktop since the
beginning of April, and I've been **meaning** to read it.

Somehow I found that funny. I just printed it out. We'll see.

(Turns out it [WAS from
Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/procrastination/overcome-procrastination-by-understanding-it-165009.php).)
