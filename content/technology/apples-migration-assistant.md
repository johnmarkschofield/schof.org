So I just upgraded my office computer from a dual-processor G5 to a new
"Quad-Proc" ((Of course, it's not REALLY quad-processor. It's two
dual-core processors. But it's still really fricking cool.)) and I used
Apple's Migration Assistant to move my files over. Pulled the hard drive
from my old Mac, stuck it in my new one, booted up (from the new drive)
and ran the assistant. ((I could have connected the two Macs with a
Firewire cable and booted the old one up in Target Disk Mode -- but SATA
is much faster than Firewire.)) No sweat. Moved my files, settings, and
applications over while I ate lunch, and now I'm working on it this
afternoon. It's really an amazingly cool product. I wish I had this
years and years ago. Of course, I've got so much weird shit installed on
my computer that I'm a bit of an edge case. Problems I've found so far:

1.  It didn't copy over my Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer driver
    correctly. On the plus side, it WARNED me that I would have to
    reinstall it. Did so and it's working great.
2.  I use [Kinkless GTD](http://kinkless.com) along with [OmniOutliner
    Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/) to keep
    myself organized. Kinkless does a lot of customizations to Omni
    Outliner, which did not carry over. Neither did the Kinkless
    scripts. I think I'll have to reinstall Kinkless GTD. <span
    style="text-decoration:line-through;">I will update this as I fix
    the problem.</span> Reinstalling Kinkless GTD fixed my problem, with
    no further action necessary.
3.  <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Microsoft Office install
    was not carried over. I had to reinstall.</span> Nope. It was there.
    Just had to run it again to reinstall all the crap it dumps
    everywhere on the hard drive. Fricking Microsoft software.
4.  I had QuickTime Pro on the old computer. Had to re-enter serial
    number. (This one I completely blame on Apple, because it's Apple
    software. Not yet pointing fingers for the other issues.<span
    style="text-decoration:line-through;"> Although Microsoft Office is
    pretty fricking common.</span>)
5.  Serial numbers for Pages and Keynote (iwork) did not carry over.
    (Migration Assistant actually COPIED my copies of Keynote and Pages
    to a new folder--"iWork '06 (from old Mac)"-- but both the existing
    iWork apps and the "from old Mac" iWork apps show up as
    unregistered.
6.  The Kerio Mailserver admin console no longer works. Starts and then
    immediately exists. Downloading and reinstalling fixed it, and it
    kept my old settings.
7.  Printer settings and drivers did not copy over. Had to reinstall
    printer drivers (that weren't included with OS) and re-setup
    printers.
8.  PocketMac for Blackberry did not work after the transfer. Had to
    reinstall. It did not preserve my registration, so I had to re-enter
    the registration information.
9.  [REALbasic](http://realbasic.com) did not hold on to my registration
    information. On the plus side, it gave me a brand-new 15-day trial.
10. The Dantz Retrospect backup client was copied over but not
    configured. I had to reconfigure it.
11. Passwords Plus lost the ability to read my passwords file. <span
    style="text-decoration:line-through;">This is bad. I currently have
    an e-mail into their support department asking for help.</span>
    Turned out I needed to completely uninstall Passwords Plus
    (including data files), reboot, and copy over the data files from
    the disk image of my old computer. Not being a dummy, I had that
    backup, so everything's cool now.
12. Textpander settings didn't transfer over properly. The settings did,
    just Texpander wasn't enabled. Enabling it fixed the issue, and my
    expansions WERE transferred over properly.
