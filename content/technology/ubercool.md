In my professional capacity as head geek at a mid-sized small business
in Los Angeles, I deal with a lot of bad tech support. A lot. I've seen
the excellent (Xerox), the good (HP Large Format Printer Support), and
the incredibly bad (HP Consumer Printer Support).

Technically speaking, I'm still waiting for a callback from Fujifilm's
Pro Support Line. I placed it with "critical" importance about three
months ago.

So I wanted to recognize [Übersmith.](http://ubersmith.com) We're trying
out their web-based CRM product, and I reported a decent-sized bug to
them at 9:30 a.m. Friday. At 10:15 a.m. the same day I got an e-mail
telling me the problem had been fixed -- and I checked and it actually
had been fixed. Pretty impressive. They do lose points, however, for the
umlaut in their name. Motley Crüe this isn't.

**Updated March 8, 2005:** Turns out übersmith can't filter on "CC"
fields in e-mail -- just To, Subject, From, and Body. I sent in a
feature request at noon today. At 12:22 PM I got an e-mail saying they'd
added it to the feature list for the next version, to be released in 3 -
4 months. At 2:54 PM I got an e-mail saying it had turned out be fairly
trivial to implement, and they'd done it. I checked it, and again, they
had done it and it worked. These folks are impressive, umlaut and all.
