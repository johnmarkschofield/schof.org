I canceled hiking this morning; they are advising Topanga residents to
listen to radio and television throughout the day in case the fire
department issues evacuation orders. I'm putting valuable papers in my
car and getting ready to pack up the cats and computers. I was heading
south on PCH, saw dozens of fire trucks with sirens on heading North on
PCH towards Malibu.

At that time (9 AM), PCH was open at least North past Topanga, and
Topanga Canyon was completely open.

I'll be posting updates as more information comes in on
<http://twitter.com/schof> and here.

**Update 10:39 AM**: Fire is in the [area around
Pepperdine.](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=pepperdine+university,+malibu,+ca&sll=34.06308,-118.6995&sspn=0.110353,0.185566&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=34.034737,-118.704185&spn=0.055195,0.092783&z=14&iwloc=addr "Map of Pepperdine University")
I'm about [12.5 miles away from that by
road](http://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=Pepperdine+University-Malibu,+24255+Pacific+Coast+Hwy,+Uninc+Los+Angeles+County,+CA&geocode=&dirflg=&saddr=canon+View+Trail,+Topanga,+CA&f=d&sll=34.03475,-118.7042&sspn=0.006899,0.011598&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=13 "Distance between me and fire.");
less as the bird (or fire) flies.

**Update 10:45 AM**: Malibu Castle completely engulfed in flame. Photos

[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/), fire now at 1,200

**Update 12:33 PM:** Press Conference with Chief Micah Freeman of LA
County Fire Dept. One thousand acres burned with zero containment.
Aircraft are working the East flank of the fire because wind is driving
the fire in SE direction parallel to PCH. No injuries to citizens or
firefighters. Two commercial structures are a total loss; three
residences are a total loss; 9 additional residences with moderate to
minor damage. Four businesses at Colony Creek Shopping Center sustained
damage. Fire is currently moving East towards Carbon Canyon area. Fire
will last for days; thousands of homes will be threatened over course of
fire. Voluntary evacuations: Coral Canyon, Carbon Canyon, Carbon Mesa,
and Rambla Pacifica. Mandatory evacuations: Montenido, Malibu Colony,
Puerco Canyon, Sweetwater Canyon. PCH is closed between Kanan Dune Road

based on the press conference above.

**Update 1:47 PM**: There's a site just created for Malibu Fire
coverage: <http://www.malibufires.org/> (Via
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/).)

**Update 1:50 PM**: MalibuFire.org's map of the fire:

[![An updated map](http://www.latimes.com/media/graphic/2007-10/33371177.jpg)](http://www.malibufires.org/)

I've also been updating my [Google Map of fire progress and evacuations
and road
closures](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&t=h&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.04345,-118.678093&spn=0.055189,0.120935&z=14).

**Update 1:54 PM**: [LA County Fire updated their status
page](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/):

> Malibu Wildfire is at 0% containment now at 1000+ acres. Several homes
> have been destroyed. Currently Evacuation Center is at Zuma Beach
> area, Firestone Field House and Agoura High School.
>
> Mandatory Evacuations:
>
> -   Montenedo
> -   Malibu Rd
> -   Malibu Colony
> -   Pepperdine
> -   Malibu Crest
> -   Serra Retreet
> -   Big Rock
>
> Information on Animal Evacuations are:  
>  Large Animals (818) 991-0071 Desoto/Victory  
>  Small Cats/Dogs evacuation location is  
>  Agoura Shelter

**Update 2:00 PM**: If LA County Fire Dept. info is correct, Big Rock
Road is being mandatory evacuated. That leapfrogged some voluntary
evacuation notices, and appears to signal a significant move or
threatened move of the fire to the East.

**Update 2:53 PM**: More news from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/)'s scanner:

> Fire moving in both directions - just dropped to the hill above the
> Malibu Pier and is running uphill toward Saddle Peak.
>
> 800 firefighter now in Malibu. 1,000 more on the way. Firefighters'
> shift change has begun, with fresh companies relieving those who have
> been at work since before dawn.

**Update 2:55 PM**: [LA County Fire](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/) says
we're now at 1200+ acres; still zero containment.

**Update 2:58 PM**: [Pepperdine says](http://emergency.pepperdine.edu/):

> Students, faculty, and staff members who were relocated to the Tyler
> Campus Center, Payson Library, and Firestone Fieldhouse were allowed
> to return to their dorms and on-campus residences around 2 p.m. All
> are requested not to leave campus.
>
> The Health and Counseling Centers have relocated to the Rho parking
> lot and will remain open until 9 p.m. for all members of the
> Pepperdine community in need of their services. Flashlights will
> distributed throughout the Pepperdine community due to cyclical power
> outages.
>
> All classes on the Malibu campus have been cancelled tomorrow, Oct.
> 22. Only critical support personnel should report to campus tomorrow.
> The Pepperdine graduate campuses outside of Malibu will be open
> tomorrow and classes will be held. Only critical communication
> systems, such as email, Internet connectivity, and telephone services,
> will likely be available.

This matches what I've been hearing about the fires around Malibu Canyon
being largely out, and the main thrust of the fire now being Eastward
along PCH.

**Update 3:05 PM**: [MalibuFires.org](http://www.malibufires.org/) just
cut-and-pasted my entire coverage onto their front page. It's all
cool -- this is about getting the information out there, not monetizing
clicks.

**Update 3:17 PM**: Cable went out, so no more TV. I'll try to stream
something to get more reports. Verizon FIOS (obviously) still working.

**Update 3:32 PM**: Watching Channel 4 on streaming video now. I
continue to update the [Google Maps with new fire
locations](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&t=h&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.040978,-118.660433&spn=0.010295,0.015171&z=16).
Burning heavily on hills above PCH just West of Carbon Mesa road.

**Update 3:35 PM:** New photo from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/):

[![Fire photo](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2218/1678558405_5818d1c8c3.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=1678558405&size=m)

**Update 3:40 PM**: Looks like the fire around Malibu Canyon is starting
to burn again. So sez Channel 4.

**Update 3:45 PM:** MrPuffy has [a bunch of photos from Saddle Peak
Road](http://flickr.com/photos/8283620@N04/) looking down at the Malibu
Fire. Channel 4 says 2000 acres burned; five residential structures
destroyed; five commercial structures destroyed, and five residential
structures damaged. Fire now appears to be moving West, says fire
fighter interviewed.

**Update 3:43 PM**: News from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/):

> It's been quiet for half an hour now. Absolutely no wind, but we know
> that can't last. The fire burns south and east of us, zero percent
> contained, a hundred percent unpredictable.
>
> Residents in the Cove are restless. We're caught between two traffic
> stops - Malibu Canyon and Kanan Road. Can't go south at all. North is
> iffy - you might get out, but chances of being allowed back in are
> slim. So we're stuck, waiting to see what the wind will do, where the
> fire will go. We walk to the bluff to watch smoke waft from the cleft
> in the hills and wonder what piece of our sweet home town we're losing
> now.

**Update 3:53 PM**: Updated [Google
Map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&t=h&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.042561,-118.642216&spn=0.02059,0.030341&z=15);
Voluntary Evacs changed to Mandatory. Got permission from

**UPDATE 4:01 PM**: More from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/):

> And just like that, the fire heads west.
>
> The wind kicked up again a few minutes ago, hot and strong and steady.
> Smoke pours out of Latigo Canyon, where planes and 'copters swarm.
> Almost 4 p.m.. We're heading into autumn dusk, an unsettling time to
> lose the light. Time to collect the dogs, pack the Plymouth and think
> about the best place to spend the night.

**Update 4:14 PM**: I see smoke North of me up Topanga Canyon. Not sure
how that's possible unless wind direction has shifted. Just had a
water-dropping helicopter fly over my house. Getting close to hauling
ass.

**Update 4:21:** I think the smoke I see is from the Chatsworth fire, as
weather.com shows the wind coming out of the NE -- which means it's NOT
blowing the fire towards me.

**Update 4:40 PM**: Press Conference with Zev Yaroslavsky: Mandatory
evacuation of lower part of Topanga Canyon, Lower Tuna Canyon area.
People in Topanga Canyon are asked to take large animals to Pierce
College immediately as a precaution. Sherrif Lee Baca: Evacuated
Pepperdine, central Malibu, Rambla Pacifico, Las Flores, Carbon Canyon,
Big Rock have all been evacuated. Tuna Canyon is being evacuated. Ocean
side (near beach) of Topanga Canyon is being evacuated.

LA County Fire Chief: Fire has consumed more than 1200 acres; they have
made considerable progress. Fire is being held in Carbon Mesa/Carbon
Canyon area by air drops. No air drops will made after dark. Fire still
not contained. Winds will double after dark. Approximately 700
firefighters are on site; 350 additional coming in overnight. 1500
people have been evacuated. Another couple of days at least until fire
is contained. Malibu Canyon road between PCH and Piuma is closed until
further notice. PCH is closed between Kanaan Dune and Topanga. 5
single-family dwellings and two commercial buildings destroyed. 9
single-family dwellings damaged; 5 businesses damaged. Topanga
Elementary closed tomorrow; all schools in Malibu closed tomorrow.

**Update: 5:02 PM**: From [LA County Fire
Site](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/): School Closures Tomorrow:

> Malibu HS, Malibu Middle School, Point Dune Elementary, Webster
> Elementary, Cabrillo Elementary

**Update: 5:05 PM:**
[Deneill](http://flickr.com/photos/deneill/1679563243/) took some great
photos of the fire:

[![Fire](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2215/1679563243_2abb9151a6.jpg?v=0)](http://flickr.com/photos/deneill/1679563243/)

**Update 5:08 PM**: Feeling uneasy, but not yet evacuating. Fire seems
to be holding firm at Carbon Canyon / Carbon Mesa. This is good, except
that winds are expected to pick up at night, and the helicopters can't
drop water at night. They are performing mandatory evacuations in
"Lower/Beach Side Topanga Canyon," but I don't really know how far that
extends. I'm going to start loading up the car just in case, and getting
the cat cages ready.

**Update 5:43 PM:** Chabad of Malibu evacuates their Torah:

**Update 6:43 PM**: Got the automated call asking me to evacuate. People
South of Topanga Center should go south on Topanga to PCH, and then East
on PCH to Pallisades High School. People North of Topanga Center (That's
me!) should head North on Topanga to the Valley, and...I didn't really
pay attention. I'm heading, cats-in-hand, to my parents house. Computer
being shut down. Will update further tonight if possible.

**NOTE**: This is NOT a rush, panicked evacuation. We can't see flames,
and it's probably just a precaution. Still, I said all along that when I
got the voluntary evacuation notice, I would go. I'm going.

**Update 10:07 AM, October 22:** All additional news [will be posted
here](http://blog.sudosu.net/2007/malibu-fire-day-2-oct-22/), on an
article for today's date:
