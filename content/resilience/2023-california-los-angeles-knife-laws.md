First of all, let me disclaim that I'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. I've included sources for where I get the information, but it's entirely possible that I've misinterpreted the sources, or the sources themselves were wrong. Use this information at your own risk. I welcome any corrections or suggestions!

This was written in December 2023. If you're looking at it much later than that, it may be out-of-date.

This covers California, Los Angeles and nearby cities, Los Angeles County, and California, because that's where I live, and it covers carrying knives, not selling them.

### TLDR

Details follow, but here's the summary:

  1. You may carry concealed or visible any folding knife with a blade shorter than 3 inches
  2. Unless you're going into a school or university of any kind, in which only blades shorter than 2.5 inches that do not lock are OK. (Basically, rules out any knife useful for defense.)
  3. Unless you're going into a Los Angeles City facility, in which case no knifes of any kind are allowed.





### Los Angeles City

#### [SEC. 55.10. CARRY KNIVES OR DAGGERS IN PLAIN VIEW PROHIBITED.](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-137973)

  * You may not carry (in plain view) any knife with a blade longer than 3 inches, or any ice pick, straight-edge razor, or similar.
  * Exceptions are when you're carrying it for your job, or for recreation (camping, etc.) or for religious reasons.
  * **Visible knives with blades less than 3 inches are OK.**
  * Knives with blades greater than 3 inches but hidden are OK?

#### [SEC. 63.134. CITY PROPERTY AND FACILITIES – PROHIBITED ITEMS.](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-357008)

* You are subject to search any time you enter a city facility
* No weapons prohibited by state law (duh!)
* No bear repellant, mace, or pepper spray
* No bat or baton
* No box-cutter, utility knife, or razor blade
* No ice pick
* No knife of any length
* No martial arts weapon of any kind
* No brass knuckles or similar
* No sword or similar
* **Basically you can't take any weapon-ish thing into a City facility**
* Only exception is if you're a cop; no recreation or job-related exceptions.


#### [SEC. 63.44. REGULATIONS AFFECTING PARK AND RECREATION AREAS.](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-159459)

* Within any zoological garden located within a public park (oddly specific) you can not possess any knife with a blade longer than 3 inches.


### Los Angeles County

#### [Chapter 13.62 - CARRYING KNIVES IN PLAIN VIEW](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT13PUPEMOWE_DIV8WE_CH13.62CAKNPLVI)

* You can not open-carry any knife with a blade of three inches or longer, any spring-blade, switch-blade, or snap-blade knife, any ice pick or straight-edge razor.
* Normal exceptions for work- or recreation-related carrying.


### California

#### [California’s Knife Laws – What You Need to Know](https://www.robertmhelfend.com/criminal-defense/californias-knife-laws/)

Unfortunately I was unable to find direct links to regulations, but this summary was useful.


* No switchblades with blade length longer than 2 inches.
* Folding knives of any length are legal and may be carried concealed
* Fixed-blade knives must be open-carried; concealed is illegal

Awesome, right? However, there's a lot of place-specific rules that get in the way.

* You can not have any switchblade or a fixed-blade knife with a blade over four inches in a state or local public building.
* In any school or university, you can't have a folding knife greater than 2.5 inches or a folding knife with a locking blade.
