New reports of a fire near Kanan Dune Rd. in Malibu. For my family and
friends, this is nowhere near me. Farther than the last fire.

I'll be updating on this site as I get information. Probably not as
frequent updates as last time. My Internet is out at home (unrelated to
the fire) and I'm blogging this from Mimosa Cafe. Please text or call
310-430-1873 with tips and breaking news. E-mail is jschofield at
gmail.com.

Note that I will be posting each update as individual posts, rather than
updating an existing post. I think that will work better.
