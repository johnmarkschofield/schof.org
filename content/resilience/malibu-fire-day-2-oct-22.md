Title: Malibu Fire, Day 2 (Oct 22)
Date: 2007-10-22 10:07
Tags: fire, malibu, topanga


Updates will be sketchy today; I'm at work and will be trying to get
actual work done. Still evacuated; don't know when I'll be going back.
Traffic in general in LA area a complete nightmare today, especially
since Topanga is closed to traffic. Two+ hours to get to work today.

**Update 10:10 AM**: [LA County Fire](http://fire.lacounty.gov/) says
2400+ acres burned; still 0% containment.

**Update 10:18 AM**: Pepperdine updated their [emergency
page](http://emergency.pepperdine.edu/)at 9:45 AM:

> All classes on the Malibu campus have been cancelled for today, Oct.
> 22. Only critical support personnel should report to campus via PCH
> south from Kanan Dume Rd. The Pepperdine graduate campuses outside of
> Malibu will be open and classes will be held. Only critical
> communication systems, such as email, Internet connectivity, and
> telephone services, will likely be available today.
>
> Students, faculty, and staff members who were relocated to the Tyler
> Campus Center, Payson Library, and Firestone Fieldhouse were allowed
> to return to their dorms and on-campus residences around 2 p.m.
> yesterday. All have been requested not to leave campus.
>
> All roads leading to Pepperdine University are closed.
>
> For regularly updated information, please call the toll free emergency
> hotline at (888) 286-5659.

**Update 10:20 AM**: More news from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/), with photos:

> Deep in the canyons the fire still burns, though nothing like the
> infernos in Canyon Country or San Diego County. Here in Malibu we're
> in the watchful, woeful mode, just beginning to absorb the changes to
> our little town. Winds are high and so dry, your skin stretches tight
> and your lips crack. PCH is clamped shut, strict roadblocks at Puerco
> Canyon and Kanan Road. The Civic Center is a staging area for everyone
> who has a hand in keeping us safe.

**Update 10:24 AM**: From [National Interagency Fire
Center](http://www.nifc.gov/fire_info/nfn.htm):

> 2,400 acres at 10 percent contained. This fire is two miles north of
> Milibu. Mandatory evacuations were implemented in Monte Nido, Malibu
> Colony, Malibu Road, Sweetwater Canyon, Puerco Canyon, Carbon Canyon,
> Carbon Mesa, Rambla Pacifica, Big Rock and Topanga Canyon tactical
> zone 8. Several roads in the area are closed.

**Update 10:26 AM**: Another bulletin with photo from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/):

> Our fire, about 2,500 acres, is now 10 percent contained. It burns
> east of Carbon Canyon, though with high winds, all parts of the city
> remain on alert. All schools here and in Topanga are closed.

**Update 10:34 AM**: More news from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/):

> The major update at this time: tanker planes now fighting the fire,
> which burns with renewed vigor, in Carbon Canyon area.

"Renewed vigor" in Carbon Canyon area is bad for Topanga.

**Update 11:26 AM**: [LA County Fire](http://fire.lacounty.gov/)
confirms 10% containment figure.

**Update 11:36 AM**: Fire Fact Sheet from Malibu City:

> This information was provided by the Fire Department:
>
> Time of Alarm: 4:55 a.m. Sunday, October 21, 2007
>
> Acres burned: 2400 acres
>
> Current condition: 10% contained
>
> Expected containment time: Unknown
>
> Firefighters assigned: 1446+
>
> Structures burned: 5 single family dwellings, 1 church, 1 commercial
> trailer
>
> Structures damaged: 9 single family dwellings, 5 commercial businesses
>
> Evacuation status: 500 homes / approximately 1500 people

Only really new information on fact sheet is that almost 1500
firefighters are assigned to the Malibu Fire. I suspect that the
evacuation count does not include people (like me!) who live outside
Malibu.

**Update 10:39 AM:** Malibu City Evacuation Status page has more detail
on where in Topanga mandatory evacuation stops and voluntary starts.

> Per information from the Fire Department:
>
> All Mandatory evacuations remain in effect. The Topanga and Sunset
> Mesa voluntary evacuations also remain in place. Be alert and be
> prepared and continue to monitor television and radio news.
>
> Mandatory evacuations:ﾠ Malibu Knolls, Malibu Colony,
> SweetwaterﾠCanyon, Malibu Road, ﾠCarbon Canyon, Carbon Mesa, Puerco
> Canyon, Rambla Pacifico, Monte Nido, Big Rock and Topanga Canyon south
> of Saddle Peak and Tuna Canyon
>
> Voluntary evacuations:ﾠ Corral Canyon, Sunset Mesa, Old Topanaga
> Canyon, Hillside Drive and areas south
>
> Red Cross Evacuation Centers have been set up at Agoura High School
> and Palisades High School.ﾠ

**Update 11:49 AM**: From [LA
Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-fire23oct23,0,2418055,print.story?coll=la-home-center):

> The fire was pushed by winds that strengthened early today and

>  ...
>
> Carbon Canyon is narrow, traversed by a serpentine two-lane road.
> Multimillion-dollar homes are along the ridgelines.
>

I assume Las Flores Canyon is the trigger point for mandatory
evacuation, because they've already called for voluntary evacuation of
Topanga.

Other fires in the area are also wreaking havoc; they are diverting
resources from Malibu to Orange County and San Diego. Appropriately, in
my opinion -- apparently 250,000 people have been evacuated in San Diego
county.

**Update 12:03 PM**: According to City of Malibu Evacuation Information,
Piuma Road south of Saddle Peak has been added to Voluntary evacuation
list.

**Update 12:05 PM**: New from

**Update 12:10 PM**: City Of Malibu has a not-particularly informative
fire map. I can't see road names or exactly where stuff is. My [Google
Map also
updated](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=110445133727901355192.00043d057b853a9fa91c6&ll=34.100149,-118.690796&spn=0.243353,0.332336&z=12&om=1),
but since I can't watch TV here, fire info not as recent. New info from
[Pepperdine's emergency site](http://emergency.pepperdine.edu/):

> Pepperdine University officials continue to work closely with local,
> county, and state fire officials regarding the Malibu Canyon fire.
>
> At the present time, students, faculty, and staff on the Malibu campus

> All classes on the Malibu campus have been cancelled for today, Oct.
> 22. All Pepperdine campuses outside Malibu are open for classes.
>
> A decision will be made later today whether Malibu campus classes will
> be held tomorrow, Oct 23. Another update will be posted at 4 p.m.

**Update 12:34 PM:** [LA County Fire](http://fire.lacounty.gov/)has
their own Google Map up. [RCMurphy](http://flickr.com/photos/rcmurphy/)
is posting more photos around Malibu Center.

**Update 12:40 PM**: Wanted to highlight this comment -- see the
original in the comments at the bottom of the page. This is about the
City of Malibu fire map I mentioned earlier.

> Did a quick photoshop superimposition of the Malibu map over a Google

>
> The eastern extent is past Sweetwater, nearing but about halfway
> between Sweetwater and Carbon Mesa.
>
> As far as I can tell, assuming my overlay was lined up right.

**Update 1:33 PM:** News from
[HereInMalibu](http://www.laobserved.com/malibu/) -- Wind shift is bad
news.

> Upper Las Flores Canyon now in flames.

Given what we've heard previously about fire in Las Flores triggering
mandatory evacuations in Topanga, Topanga residents can probably expect
to be told to leave shortly.

**Update 1:42 PM**: And there it is. I'm working from multiple,
sometimes conflicting sources of information here -- and I'm safely
ensconced in Santa Monica where I can't see anything firsthand -- but it
looks like all of Topanga is being evacuated. The below list includes
"Topanga" (unqualified for the first time) and "Southwest portion of
Topanga Canyon Boulevard." This is timestamped 1:35 PM from the [LA
Times
website](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-roads23oct23,0,6013326,full.story?coll=la-home-center):

**Update 2:04 PM:** Just spoke with my neighbor; he has not yet been
told to mandatory evacuate. Called [T-CEP](http://www.t-cep.org/):

**Update 4:51 PM**: [Di

**Update 5:04 PM:** This is a NASA satellite photo of the fires. The
first taken at 11:35 AM; the second at 2:50 PM. Red outline shows the

News of note there is that there used to be almost 1500 firefighters;
they're clearly drawing down the force to take care of the other
wildfires in the area. Other new news is that the burn area is up to
2000 acres.

**Update 6:04 PM**: More from

**Update 6:19 PM**: City of Malibu reports 2400 acres as of 5:30 PM.
Also, their Fire Fact Sheet reports additional structures damaged and
destroyed:

**Update 6:23 PM**: Sigh. [LA County
Fire](http://www.fire.lacounty.gov/) now reports 2700+ acres.

**Update 6:27 PM**: I'm leaving work. I'll be heading to my parents'
home to pick up my car, and will then check conditions and evaluate
whether or not I can head up Topanga to clear some more stuff out of my
house. (I've got all the REALLY important stuff -- but there is some art
on the walls, prints of my photos, etc. that I'd love to save. Still
feel that my house won't be in the path of the fire, but I'm much less
confident than I used to be.

**Update 10:54 PM:** Headed up to Topanga. Had to show ID and phone bill
to CHP to get past checkpoint at Topanga and Mulholland. (My ID doesn't
show my Topanga address.) Got a small load of stuff -- paintings, framed
photos, a few pieces of sculpture, and a bunch of clothes. Now back at
the 'rents and going to sleep. More updates tomorrow, again interspersed
with work. (Hopefully with much more work.)

**Update 8:44 AM Oct 23**: Further updates will be posted here:
