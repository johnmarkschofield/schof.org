Title: Personal Update: Malibu Fire

I just got the call for voluntary evacuation, and I am heeding the call.

I have time (can't see flames; they haven't crested any hills around me)
so I'm packing up essentials and heading to my parent's house. With
cats, which should go over wonderfully with the parents.

I'm turning off the computers now, and taking some of them with me. I
may be blogging about this later tonight; I may not. If you have my
phone number, feel free to call; especially if you're worried. If you
don't have my phone number, feel free to direct-twitter me
(http://twitter.com/schof) and it will be texted to my phone.

I strongly suspect that the flames will not reach my part of Topanga.
Still, I've said all along that if I got the call for voluntary
evacuation, I would go. I'm going.

Update 9:42 PM: Safely set up at my parents' house. Several SEVERELY
pissed-off cats hiding under my old single bed. All the essentials
loaded in my car, and the house fire-proofed as much as possible. (Not
very.)
