Title: The Best Nickname Yet

I was called a lot of things in Elementary School -- none of which I
liked. I first got a nickname I liked at Parkman Jr. High School, when
my friends started calling me "Schof." (Incidentally, the "Sch" in
"Schofield" is pronounced like the "sch" in "school." Same with
"Schof" -- phonetically "skoaf.")

I always liked "Schof," and that's what my close friends call me --
although when I was stage managing I got some nicknames that went from
odd to surreal:

-   Schofinator
-   Schofie
-   Schofie Anan
-   Boutrous Boutros Schofie

There were more.

But in my 39th year I got a nickname that I like best of all: "Daddy
John." I had never been married and had no kids, and I started dating a
wonderful woman (M., who I'm now married to) with an eight-year-old
daughter (H.) and a four-year-old nephew (E.). Since my girlfriend lived
with her sister, I spent a lot of time with H. and E., and they came up
with "Daddy John" for me. When I walked into the apartment it was "Daddy
John!" and both would run over to hug me.

Now I live with M. and H., and E. spends a good part of the week with
us -- and I'm still very much "Daddy John" to them. There's nothing
better than getting home after a rough day at work and getting jumped on
with delight by two kids shouting my name.

I'm Daddy John now. And that's just fine with me.
