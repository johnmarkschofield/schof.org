Title: Not The Sum Of My Tears
Date: 2007-03-22 18:27

When I was 11 years old, and camping with the Boy Scouts on Catalina
Island, I was raped by my Assistant Scoutmaster.

Last night at my group therapy session, I had a shocking realization.
(I've often thought that instead of its current title, my poetry "book"
should be called "My Shitty Epiphany.")

I'm very much in touch with all the [pain I've
experienced](http://schof.org/2001/03/04/the-sum-of-tears/ "The Sum OfÂ Tears")
as a result of that rape (I prefer not to call it a "molestation.") --
but I discovered that I'm not at all in touch with the good things I let
myself miss because of this.

Last week's session felt like I made some real progress, and I noticed
two changes as a result -- first, I was really testy with almost
everyone around me, and second, I felt much closer, felt much more
warmth and affection, for my girlfriend, K.

The crankiness does not surprise me -- when you start dealing with
buried anger as I am, a little may leak out when you stir things up. But
the wave of love and affection? Have I been burying those feelings along
with the anger all these years? My sense of loss is almost palpable
here -- what other things have I allowed myself to miss, or not allowed
myself to enjoy because of all this buried anger, fear, guilt, and
grief?

Therapy has been something I did to avoid pain -- now it may become
something that opens the door to joy. That's a very different thing.
