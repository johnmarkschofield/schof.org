On Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2016, my mother Anne Lise (Lis) Schofield, died from complications of her dementia. (She had either vascular dementia or Alzheimer's -- doctors differed in their diagnosis.)

Her husband and my father, Miles Schofield, died November 11, 2014.

Lis leaves her sister Grethe, her son John, and John's wife Marlyse and two children Heather and James.

The service will be Saturday, February 27, at 12:30 PM at [Oakwood Memorial Park](http://www.oakwoodmemorialcemetery.com/), near Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley:
<pre>
22601 Lassen St.
Chatsworth, CA 91311
</pre>

There will be a service at the chapel at Oakwood Memorial, followed by the burial next to my father.

Afterwards we will travel to our home for refreshments and remembrances. We'll provide directions at the funeral.
