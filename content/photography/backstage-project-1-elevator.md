In 2010 I conceived the project of documenting the backstage lives of
musicians and artists. The public sees them on stage, but doesn't see
them in on a filthy couch backstage trying to stay connected to fans on
Facebook via their phones or laptops.

The first play I was able to shoot backstage was
"[Elevator](http://www.elevatortheplay.com/)." They agreed to let me
shoot in return for using their pick of my photos for publicity. I was
there for their entire tech week, through triumphs, disasters, cast
upsets, and crew changes. Tech week -- the week before opening night
when the crew and cast have to come together for the first time to
produce a complete play -- can be brutal, exhausting, and upsetting.
When it's easy it's rough, and when it's rough it's the [Bataan Death
March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataan_Death_March).

I felt really privileged and honored to be allowed behind the scenes of
"Elevator," and the cast and crew were wonderful in making me feel at
home and at ease while they were under so much tremendous stress and
pressure.
