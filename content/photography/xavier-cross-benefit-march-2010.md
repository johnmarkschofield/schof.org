Title: Xavier Cross Benefit, March 2010
Date: 2010-03-06

This is my third real exploration of both my renewed interest in
photography and my new camera, my Panasonic Lummix GF1.  I had a great
time, and it was very gracious of
[Yoko](http://www.yokomorimoto.com/) to invite me to the benefit and show me around.

Photographically speaking there were a few big lessons. First, hold the
damn camera steady! I ruined a number of shots this way. I think part of
it is my nervousness about shooting people in the crowd. I felt
perfectly comfortable shooting the performers, but felt very shy about
shooting random people attending. (Despite the fact that nobody seemed
to mind, and a number of people actively vamped for the camera. Of
course, that's a completely separate problem, as I'm trying to get
slice-of-life photos, not posed shots.)

The second lesson was bump up my ISO. I shot at ISO 800, and didn't go
higher because I was concerned about graininess. I'll definitely have to
experiment with higher-ISO shots to see if that gets me the higher
shutter-speed I need without getting too grainy. Here's the first real
example of the problem that I decided to keep:

This one kills me. It's
the beautiful and talented [Sunny Soriano](http://sunnysoriano.com/) and
her partner. This is exactly the type of photo I'm trying to
take -- capturing something like the peak of action. And it's blurry as
hell, not because of the extreme speed of the performers, but because I
had too slow a shutter speed, and too shaky a hand.

There were about five artists painting live, doing works that were going
to be raffled off at the benefit. (I didn't win anything.)   This is
Ceci Castelblanco:

I love this shot of Ceci. Something about dark, painterly tones really gets
me. I didn't get any shots of the fire performers that I really loved, but I like how
the pose for one aerialist worked out. He's hanging by a strap around
the back of his
head!

All in all it was a blast, and I'm really glad I went. I hope there's an
equally interesting photography adventure this coming weekend!
