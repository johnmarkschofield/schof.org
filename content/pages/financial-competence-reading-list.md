Title: Financial Competence Reading List

Introduction
------------



This is a short course in Financial Competence, written for fellow
autodidacts. The texts in the "Essential Reading" section are exactly
that -- books, articles, white papers, and web pages -- that constitute
the minimum of essential reading for anyone interested in reaching
financial competence.

Please note that at this time, this list is nowhere near complete. I'm
adding only books that I have myself read and talked about on this blog,
and since I'm still working my way through my financial education, so is
this list.

I suggest you read the Essential Reading section in the order listed.
For the Recommended Reading section, I'd suggest reading anything that
strikes your fancy.

It took me time to read these blogs and books, and it should take you
time as well. Pace yourself -- if you're starting from near ignorance, I
was, it will take time to work your way to financial competence.

Essential Reading
-----------------

-   [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) blog, by Mr.
    Money Mustache. Despite the ridiculous site name and pseudonym,
    Mustache is a good writer on investment issues, and the best on
    saving money. There's no writer currently out there who writes more
    moving, motivating and energetic prose about living simply and
    saving money. Mustache calls himself a badass, and he is. I highly
    recommend [starting from the first article in his blog and working
    your way
    forward](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/all-the-posts-since-the-beginning-of-time/).
-   [The Investor's
    Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U3CBY8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002U3CBY8">The Investor's Manifesto),
    by [William J.
    Bernstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Bernstein).
    William J. Bernstein is the dean of clear, concise, simple prose
    about investing. His insights are invaluable, his knowledge
    encyclopedic, and his logic clear. This should be the first book you
    read on investing.

Recommended Reading
-------------------

-   [The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of
    Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OD41DY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=schoforg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001OD41DY)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001OD41DY) by
    Alice Schroeder.
    ([Review](http://schof.org/2013/01/16/warren-buffetts-the-snowball/ "Warren Buffett’s “The Snowball”"))
    An inspiring and educational view of Buffett's life, written with
    the cooperation of Buffett, his partners, and his family.
-   [Oblivious Investor](http://www.obliviousinvestor.com/) blog by Mike
    Piper. A good general-purpose passive investing blog. Lots of good
    information.
-   [Retirement Researcher Blog](http://wpfau.blogspot.com/) by Wade
    Pfau. Incredibly thorough and detailed. I've added every page on the
    site to my Instapaper queue for further reading. Highly recommended
    for those who want to dive into this further.
-   [Mad Fientist](http://www.madfientist.com/) blog, by [the Mad
    Fientist](http://www.madfientist.com/about/). Mr. Fientist is just
    getting started, but he's already put up some great articles (his
    "[Ultimate Retirement
    Account"](http://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/)
    piece was eye-opening, and I highly recommend reading it) and some
    great podcast interviews with other financial bloggers.
-   [JCollinsNH](http://jlcollinsnh.wordpress.com) blog, by [Jim
    Collins](http://jlcollinsnh.wordpress.com/about/). Jim hasn't
    written very much, but what he has written is worth reading. I
    particularly recommend his series on investing, called Stocks parts
    1 through 15. I came to Jim through Mr. Money Mustache's site, and
    it's a great introduction to index investing.

 Optional Reading

-   "[Think, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett: The Winning Strategy
    to Help You Achieve Your Financial and Life
    Goals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071809953/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071809953&linkCode=as2&tag=schoforg-20)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=schoforg-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0071809953),"

Unread Books (AKA The To-Do List)
---------------------------------

In my quest to learn more about investing, I've developed quite a list
of books to read and write about. The books in the Short List are in the
order that I'll be reading them and writing about them; the ones in the
Very Long List are not in reading order. Have an addition, a comment, or
want something moved up the list? [Contact
me](http://schof.org/contact/ "Contact John Mark Schofield") or add a
comment to the bottom of this page.
