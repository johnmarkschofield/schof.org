I create elegant solutions to difficult problems. I love creating efficient,
well-crafted automation using Python, BASH, and other tools. I learn new things
quickly, and am always trying to improve my skills.

I believe even the best solution is cheapened if nobody else can use it, and
that documentation and education are key to professionalism.

I believe that technology can be of net benefit to the world, and that ethical
behavior is just as important in technology as it is everywhere else.

I am a craftsman. I aspire to be a great one.

I am a DevOps Engineer for Metacloud (now part of Cisco) working on the
infrastructure for private cloud deployments using OpenStack.

All opinions on this site are mine (unless otherwise noted)Â and are not
necessarily shared by Cisco, Metacloud, or any other person or entity.

I live in Tarzana with my wonderful wife M. and daughter H.

I'm also a writer, a poet, an amateur photographer, (putting "amateur"
in front of "poet" is kind of redundant) an avid hiker, world traveler,
student of Spanish and French, martial-arts and firearms enthusiast, and
occasionally, a decent cook. You can [get in touch with me
