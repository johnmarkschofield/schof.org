I create elegant solutions to difficult problems. I love creating efficient,
well-crafted automation using Python, BASH, and other tools. I learn new things
quickly, and am always trying to improve my skills.

I believe even the best solution is cheapened if nobody else can use it, and
that documentation and education are key to professionalism.

I believe that technology can be of net benefit to the world, and that ethical
behavior is just as important in technology as it is everywhere else.

I am a craftsman. I aspire to be a great one.

I'm also a writer, a poet, an amateur photographer, (putting "amateur"
in front of "poet" is kind of redundant) an avid hiker, world traveler,
student of Spanish and French, martial-arts and firearms enthusiast, and
occasionally, a decent cook. You can [get in touch with me
