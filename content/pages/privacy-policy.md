This privacy policy is based on the [privacy policy from
Automattic.com](http://automattic.com/privacy/), and, like them, we
release it under a [Creative Commons

### Introduction

John Mark Schofield operates the schof.org website. It is my policy to
respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect while
operating my website.

Schof.org is created by the [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) static blog engine. It is hosted by
[NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net). This privacy policy applies to information that I collect. NearlyFreeSpeech may also
collect data about your visits, and any data they collect is governed by [their privacy
policy](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/privacy) and [Terms of
Service](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/terms), and I have no control or influence
over their actions.

### Data Collection

The only tracking of schof.org visitors that I do is through web server
logs. These logs include non-personally-identifiable information such as
referring site and web browser used, and also includes the IP address, which
is personally identifiable.

These server logs are retained for a period of two weeks, and are not
archived in any manner past that period.


### Aggregated Statistics

I may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to this website.
For instance, which posts are visited most. I may display this information publicly or provide
it to others. However, will not not disclose personally-identifying
information other than as described below.

### Protection of Personally-Identifying Information

I disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only to those of my employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations that need to know that information in order to process it
on my behalf or to provide services available at schof.org. Some of
those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using schof.org, you consent to the
transfer of such information to them.

I will not transfer, rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to my
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
I disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
governmental request. If you have entered your email and requested that
I send you site updates, I will email you when I post new articles to
schof.org. I take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each
time the visitor returns. Schof.org may use cookies to help identify and
track visitors, their usage of this website, and their website access
preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using this
website, with the drawback that certain features of schof.org may not
function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If schof.org, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in
the unlikely event that schof.org goes out of business or John Mark
Schofield enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
that could be transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge
that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of schof.org may
continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Ads

Schof.org does not contain advertisements of any kind. The site does
use referral programs, such as the Amazon Affiliate program, which provides
the site income when clicked by users who subsequently make purchases from, 
for example, Amazon.com. These affiliate links identify the source of the
traffic (this website) but do nothing to identify you to the company
running the affiliate program.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change this Privacy
Policy from time to time, and at my sole discretion. I encourages
visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to this Privacy
Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
