This privacy policy is based on the [privacy policy from
Automattic.com](http://automattic.com/privacy/), and, like them, we
release it under a [Creative Commons

### Introduction

John Mark Schofield operates the schof.org website. It is my policy to
respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect while
operating my website.

Schof.org is created by the [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) static blog engine. It is hosted by
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3). This privacy policy applies to information that I collect. Amazon may also
collect data about your visits, and any data they collect is governed by [their privacy policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/), and I have no control or influence over their actions.


### Data Collection

We do not use cookies or use an analytic service such as Google Analytics. We do store web server logs on Amazon S3 that we use for estimating site traffic and for diagnosing technical issues. These logs would include your IP address and the page you requested, as well as what web browser you are using. We store this data for 30 days and then delete it.



### Aggregated Statistics

We do view aggregated bandwidth used and number of GET requests data
as provided by Amazon. This information does not personally identify any
of our website visitors.


### Ads

Schof.org does not contain advertisements of any kind. The site does
use referral programs, such as the Amazon Affiliate program, which provides the site with income when affiliate links are clicked by
visitors who subsequently make purchases from, for example, Amazon.com. These affiliate links identify the source of the traffic (this website) but do nothing to identify you to the company running the affiliate program.


### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change this Privacy
Policy from time to time, and at my sole discretion. I encourages
visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to this Privacy
Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
